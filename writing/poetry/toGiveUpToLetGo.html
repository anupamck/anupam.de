            <p>We give up a battle. We let go when there is no battle.</p>
            <p>We give up in defeat. We let go in peace.</p>
            <p>We give up desire. We let go of attachment.</p>
            <p>We give up in abstinence. We let go with equanimity.</p>
            <p>We give up in tolerance. We let go with respect.</p>
            <p>We give up in inadequacy. We let go in contentment.</p>
            <p>We give up what we have. We let go of what we are.</p>
            <p>To give up is discipline. To let go is freedom.</p>
            <p>To give up is to sacrifice. To let go is to love.</p>
