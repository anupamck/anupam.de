            <p>
                We walk alongside trees in a forest,<br>
                Pine, Banyan, Bamboo depending on where you look.<br>
                Standing tall, harbouring life,<br>
                Calming our minds and rejuvenating our souls.<br>
                Trees enrich us all, not just you or me.<br>
                For they are not your trees or my trees,<br>
                But trees – manifestations of nature’s generosity.
            </p>
            <p>
                We come upon wealth in our lives,<br>
                Currency, businesses, property depending on where you look.<br>
                Real, virtual and fictitious,<br>
                Tokens and dice in the game of life.<br>
                What if wealth were like trees in a forest?<br>
                Not your wealth or my wealth,<br>
                But wealth – the gatekeeper of the garden of certainty.
            </p>
            <p>
                We share our lives with people,<br>
                Friendly, quirky, wise depending on where you look.<br>
                In all colours, shapes and sounds,<br>
                Travel companions in our eternal quest.<br>
                What if people were like trees in a forest?<br>
                Not your people or my people,<br>
                But people – slices of the consciousness divine.
            </p>
            <p>
                Time is life’s fairest measure,<br>
                Jiffys, fortnights and decades depending on where you look.<br>
                Ruthless equally to the poor and the rich,<br>
                And to the sinner and to the saint.<br>
                What if moments were like trees in a forest?<br>
                Not your moments or my moments,<br>
                But moments – slivers of eternity gifted to us.
