            <p>
                To meditate<br>
                Is to sit down<br>
                And observe one’s breath.<br>
                To feel the sensation<br>
                Of the ground below<br>
                touching one’s feet<br>
                And holding them up<br>
                With gentleness.
            </p>
            <p>
                To meditate<br>
                Is also to run<br>
                A toothbrush<br>
                Down the row of one’s teeth.<br>
                Like the fingers of<br>
                A master pianist<br>
                Along a sprinkle of keys.<br>
                Deft, yet gentle.
            </p>
            <p>
                To meditate<br>
                Is also to wash<br>
                A dirty vessel.<br>
                To scrub it with soap,<br>
                Watch it foam and lather<br>
                And pass a stream of water<br>
                To tease the grime away<br>
                And drip off its edges.
            </p>
            <p>
                To meditate<br>
                Is also to step outside<br>
                And let the cold air<br>
                Take us in embrace.<br>
                To breathe in deep<br>
                From between the nostrils<br>
                Down through the throat<br>
                And into our lungs.
            </p>
            <p>
                To meditate<br>
                Is not merely<br>
                To sit with eyes closed<br>
                And observe one’s breath.<br>
                To meditate<br>
                Is to attend to<br>
                And be engrossed<br>
                By things most mundane.
