      <p>'Be yourself', they say to us,<br>Be yourself. A life philosophy.<br>Be your self. We hear too
        often.<br>What do those words even mean?<br>What really is my 'self'?</p>



      <p>Is it that self that wanders<br>On walks of want and misery,<br>That leaps into the past and the future,<br>But
        is never present?<br>The self that promises freedom,<br>But locks me up instead by whispering<br>&#8216;You
        should be somewhere else&#8217;.</p>



      <p>Or is it that self that constantly craves<br>For the big, the new and the shiny,<br>That diminishes my
        perfectly good jacket<br>While staring at a trendy offer<br>On a pane of glass in my palm?<br>The self that
        flips without hesitation<br>To the latest fashion, the next big thing,<br>Always sampling and tasting<br>But
        never sinking and savouring.</p>



      <p>Or is it that self that is smitten by status,<br>To be in a different league as one&#8217;s peers,<br>To
        acquire new peers and start all over?<br>The self that takes stock and benchmarks,<br>Always my worst with the
        best of others,<br>That drives me to blame and flagellates me<br>Towards the next mirage on the horizon.</p>



      <p>Or is it that self that burns<br>With a fire insatiable<br>Fueled by bursts of chemical pleasure<br>That
        reduces dignity and accomplishment<br>To piles of ash and cinder?<br>The self that fills our shopping
        lists,<br>Fills cupboards and living rooms,<br>Fills garages and guest bedrooms<br>Even as it empties us out
        inside.</p>



      <p>Or is it that self that puts itself first?<br>That cries and whines like a toddler spoilt,<br>For praise,
        attention and indulgence?<br>That is oblivious to the world outside<br>Like a cat with eyelids tightly
        shut<br>That confines the infinite universe<br>To the prison cell of its individual bounds.</p>



      <p>When they say, &#8216;be yourself&#8217;,<br>Which of these monsters do I choose?<br>The self is but a fleeting
        shadow<br>Of the form that our suffering takes.<br>True wisdom is to see your self, <br>Observe it, understand
        it and separate it.<br>True wisdom, in other words, <br>Is to NOT be your self.</p>
