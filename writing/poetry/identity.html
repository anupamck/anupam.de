            <p>
                Who are you?<br>
                Are you the smiling face<br>
                On that living room portrait?<br>
                Or that ‘neutral’ face<br>
                On your passport<br>
                Looking straight ahead at the camera,<br>
                Unblinking, unfeeling?
            </p>
            <p>
                Are you merely a face<br>
                Stamped alongside a name<br>
                Printed on a card<br>
                That is authorized by<br>
                The sovereign republic of India?<br>
                But what is India?<br>
                And what authorizes India to define you?
            </p>
            <p>
                What India wants<br>
                Is to put a name and a face<br>
                To every human within its borders<br>
                To ensure that the taxes are paid<br>
                The traffic rules are obeyed<br>
                And poor Dhanraj can receive compensation<br>
                For the mangoes the urchins picked from his orchard.
            </p>
            <p>
                Is identity natural?<br>
                Would a lotus smell sweeter<br>
                If you called it a rose?<br>
                Would a bulbul be more punctual<br>
                If you called it a rooster?<br>
                Would a tiger turn vegan<br>
                If you called it a bison?
            </p>
            <p>
                Identity is a story we tell ourselves.<br>
                To keep the trains on time,<br>
                Our cities in order<br>
                And show everybody their place.<br>
                Identity is fiction.<br>
                Do not turn it into fact<br>
                Lest you fetishize suffering.
