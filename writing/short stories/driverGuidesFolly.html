      <h2>The driver guide's folly</h2>
      <span class="date">Nov 2017</span>
      <p>
        The Land Cruiser moved at a gentle pace through the vast, open grasslands of the Serengeti.
         The wide open spaces were filled with knee-high grass, for as far as the eye could see. This
        vast carpet of grass was parted by a straight mud road that stretched ahead as far as the
        eye could see, until it met with the sky that spilt into the horizon. Towards the left of
        the Land Cruiser was a herd of about a thousand wildebeest grazing, with four zebras to keep
        them company. The zebras appeared nonchalant  as they munched on the grass, having delegated
        the constant need to be alert for predators to the massive wildebeest herd. The wildebeest
        on the periphery of the herd were vigilant, but their only source of bother at this moment
        were swarms of flies that they tried to discourage by flicking their ears, quivering the skin
        on their backs and wildly swinginowheir hairy tails. A lone baobab tree stood imposingly
        in the midst of the expansive grassy plain around it, with a group of vultures seated on its
        tall, thick branches.
      </p>

      <p>
        "Can anybody tell me why the Serengeti has so few big trees?" Madoqua's voice rang out to
        his passengers in the back seat. Today, his customers were a couple from India, and their
        daughter Monica, who was watching the zebras with her little eyes wide open. Monica, was the
        type of student who would hazard a guess at every question her teachers threw at her. "Because
        the soil is not fertile enough?" she enquired. "A good guess, Monica," Madoqua replied with
        his deep voice filling the vehicle. "But the main reason is because about 6 feet under the
        soil is a thick layer of rock that does not permit the roots of anything larger than grass
        to grow."
      </p>

      <p>
        They drove to the top of a small, grassy mound and got out of the vehicle to take in the scenery.
         The tall, well-built African guide dwarfed his Indian customers. The grass was surrounded
        by shrubs tall enough to hide a crouching person. The wind blew across the plain, making elegant
        patterns as it combed the grass. “The name Serengeti is derived from the Masaai word - Serengit,
        meaning endless plains,” added Madoqua as the family was transfixed by the scenery. They had
        been touring the Serengeti for a week now, but the grasslands still sparked the same awe and
        wonder in their minds. Monica’s father remarked how the nature documentaries they watched
        each night, spectacular as they were, do no justice to the pure feeling of joy one experienced
        on the plains of the savanna. Madoqua replied, “After all, we find ourselves in the birthplace
        of the entire human race. No matter where people live across the world today, coming back
        to the grasslands of the Serengeti is like returning to our ancestral home. The beauty of
        the savanna resonates and sends ripples across all of us. The senses and feelings we use to
        interpret the world today are the ones that were developed and sharpened here.”
      </p>

      <p>
        They were riding in the vehicle again. It was the hour of dusk and it would not be long before
        they headed back. Madoqua slowed down the vehicle as they now passed thickets of shrub, where
        a pair of antelopes that were about a foot-and-a-half tall, surveyed their vehicle with wide-eyed
        curiosity and alertness. Monica pointed and exclaimed, “Baby deer!” Madoqua smiled and explained
        to her that these were actually fully grown members of a species of antelope called dik-dik.
         “Dik-diks live in pairs, and not in herds. They mark their small territories in the shrub
        with tears. They pair for life,” he added in a respectful tone and emphasized how this differentiated
        the dik-dik from other antelopes. Madoqua stopped the jeep so that the family could get a
        good view.
      </p>

      <p>
        Suddenly, amidst the rippling grass behind them to the left, Madoqua spotted an odd movement
        that was very subtle. Madoqua’s well trained eye saw something that was invisible to other
        human beings, and even the dik-dik pair - a predator stalking in the grass. He turned behind
        to his passengers and placed his finger on his lips, imploring them to maintain absolute silence.
         They had to now be patient, and lay in wait. It was a tense, silent fifteen minutes. The
        predator was biding its time, waiting for the little antelopes to move closer. By now, the
        dik-diks had strayed some distance away from the shrub. All of a sudden, the dik-diks perked
        up. The movement Madoqua had sensed in the grass was now blatant, as the family could see
        a streak of spots bolting like a torpedo, clearing the grass as it surged forward. The leopard,
        realizing that its cover was blown, charged ahead. The dik-diks split up and ran in different
        directions. The female released shrill “dik” “dik” cries – from where the antelope derived
        its name. All the herbivores in the scene were now alert, and moved a safe distance away.
        The dik-diks bolted for the safety of the shrubs.
      </p>

      <p>
        The leopard singled out the crying female, gaining on the prancing creature with giant strides.
        The chase happened alongside the track, in the direction of the vehicle, and Madoqua followed
        the action at a respectful distance. The dik-dik proceeded in a zig-zag pattern, pitting its
        nimbleness against the weight of the leopard. However, the leopard was so much faster. All
        of this was unfolding so quickly. Presently, the dik-dik in pursuit was a mere 10 meters ahead
        of the leopard, and changed direction to streak across the jeep path, to the safety of a large
        bushy patch to its right. The leopard followed in hot pursuit, using its tail for balance
        as it turned. Just when it looked like all was lost for the antelope, the dik-dik darted through
        a shortcut within the bushy patch, cutting through a route that shut out larger animals, and
        emerged on the far side. The leopard tried to flank the large bush, but the dik-dik had gained
        too much distance by now, and it gave up its chase.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Today was not her lucky day,” Madoqua explained. “The change in wind direction had revealed
        her location a little too early.” As he spoke these words, the leopard crossed the jeep track
        about 20 meters ahead of them, pausing to look directly at the vehicle, and moving along as
        if it were of no consequence. Monica’s eyes were wide open and her little heart was beating
        faster than it ever had. Madoqua relayed the sighting of the leopard on a walkie-talkie attached
        to other driver-guides in the park. “As often as I see these chases, dik-dik hunts are rare.
         Dik-diks are elusive and alert creatures,” he added. The family was delighted. The leopard
        was the only animal that they had not sighted among the ‘big-five’, and thanks to Madoqua’s
        intricate knowledge of the jungle, they were fortunate to have witnessed it in all its breathtaking
        glory. The moment the dik-dik escaped into the bushes, Madoqua had heaved a sigh of relief,
        as he had a special corner in his heart for dik-diks, the reasons for which go back to the
        days of his childhood.
      </p>

      <p>
         *****
      </p>

      <p>
        Madoqua grew up in the little village of Haributi in the northern provinces of Tanzania. Sighting
        wild animals on the horizon was commonplace in his village, where herds of elephants and gazelles
        would often pass by. Madoqua was at home in the wilderness. He had played in it as a youngster,
        and had developed a keen understanding of its ways in a manner akin to that of animal understanding
        its natural habitat. He now lived in a city, and at times, as he drove past its streets and
        houses, the experience of living in its crowded streets seemed alien to him - as though he
        was dreaming.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was only one school in the village of Haributi and Henry Odumbaya was its principal.
        The school building had been built with the help of a charitable trust, and was U-shaped,
        with a courtyard in the middle. Mr. Odumbaya, had come to Haributi as a young, idealistic
        teacher from the city, and through the course of his career he had had a transformational
        impact on the school’s education. The children of Haributi were caught in a divide between
        a remote tribal heritage and a future of modernization. Mr. Odumbaya realized that a good
        education was the only medium through which this chasm can be successfully negotiated. Madoqua
        had been taught by Mr. Odumbaya for years, and as a bright pupil, had developed a deep respect
        for him.
      </p>

      <p>
        One day, when Madoqua was a nine-year-old, a dik-dik was found in the outskirts of the village,
        its leg caught in a snare set by a poacher. The hapless antelope, a female specimen, was brought
        to the village. Mr. Odumbaya, a naturalist by training, took it under his wing. He nursed
        and bandaged its wound, and the dik-dik lived on the school campus for about two months, as
        its wounds healed. Madoqua stayed back with Mr. Odumbaya after school hours, helping him gather
        plants for feeding the dik-dik and changing its dressing. Whilst its wounds were getting dressed,
        the antelope would get agitated, crying out “dik” “dik” in panic. Madoqua would then stroke
        its fur lovingly, soothing it, as Mr. Odumbaya changed its bandages. In time, the dik-dik
        learnt to respond to his gentle caresses by looking him in the eye and trusting him enough
        to stop trembling during the painful ordeal. It was during these days that he learnt a lot
        about the dik-dik, and was fascinated. He observed that the dik-dik never drank water, and
        had learnt that its digestive system was efficient enough to get all the moisture it needed
        from the food it ate. This fact filled him with wonder. He remembered how soft and pleasant
        it felt to stroke the dik-dik’s fur. He had observed how the antelope stood on its tiny hooves,
        with its big eyes and thick eye lashes. From time to time, he would see tears streaming down
        the eyes of the dik-dik which the little animal tried to smear on walls. He had later learnt
        from Mr. Odumbaya that these were secretions with which the antelope marked their territory
        in the wild. After a couple of months, the dik-dik was moved to an animal rehabilitation center,
        and Madoqua was sad to see it go. In the years to follow, Madoqua and his friends would seek
        out patches of shrub outside their village that were once inhabited by dik-diks, to play in
        them. Madoqua would run through intricate paths within the bush, imitating the cries of the
        antelope that he had grown to love so much.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through this encounter, Madoqua had deepened his bonds to the African wilderness. His respect
        for Mr. Odumbaya and his attachment towards the dik-dik would serve as beacons for the life
        ahead of him. In time, he grew up, graduated from school and trained to become a driver-guide,
        with a degree in African tourism. Through this degree, he learnt a lot of facts about the
        grasslands and the wilderness he inhabited. He could now explain that zebras used stripes
        to repel insects, hippos and crocodiles coexisted peacefully, and hyenas used their longer
        rear legs to tirelessly pursue their prey, among many other facts. All this knowledge helped
        him discover his surroundings in a new light. He could now complement his natural affinity
        for the wilderness with facts and reasoning that that were rooted in science.
      </p>

      <p>
        Madoqua started his career as a forest guide in a big hotel chain, but for about 5 years now,
        he was working for a tourist company as a driver-guide. The driver-guide was a profession
        that was unique to the African jungles. Drivers on safari doubled up as naturalists, enlightening
        their customers with interesting facts about the African jungles and its natural wealth. He
        found his second job to be more fulfilling, as he traversed vast stretches of the savanna,
        sharing its beauty, unveiling its secrets and sparking wonder in their eyes of his guests.
         Mr. Smith, the owner of the tourist company, was a Scottish expatriate. A stern man with
        a no-nonsense approach to life, he was an exacting employer who demanded nothing short of
        the best from his driver-guides. At the same time, he would reward them amply wherever it
        was due. His driver-guides were evaluated on the basis of feedback provided by his customers,
        with lavish bonuses for guides whose customers made return trips.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through the 5 years of working with Mr. Smith, Madoqua had risen quickly through the ranks
        to become one of the Serengeti’s most trusted driver-guides. He had worked with people from
        all corners of the world, spanning various cultures and mannerisms. Each trip into the jungles
        represented to Madoqua, a challenge to delight the group that rode out with him. His continued
        attempts to excel at his profession kept his job interesting despite repeated trips along
        the same routes. However, he always felt that his abilities were constrained when he was working
        for the tourist company. He had to operate within several of its rigid guidelines, which kept
        him from being the best he could at his profession. When he was with a senior colleague, he
        had to defer to his wishes – stick to areas of the park which were not particularly bountiful
        or to keep his trips shorter than he liked. It substantially curtailed his earning potential
        by letting him keep only a small part of what each customer paid the company - an amount that
        Madoqua thought was incommensurate to his efforts. Over the years, Madoqua had come to the
        conclusion that he would be better off as a freelance guide. He now had a sufficiently large
        network of customers, and had established enough contacts at the jungle lodges, hotels and
        resorts to obtain discounted rates for his customers. The only thing holding him back was
        that he did not have a vehicle of his own, and he was determined to realize this at the earliest.
         This ambition ensured that Madoqua relentlessly pursued every important opportunity that
        came his way.
      </p>

      <p>
        One day, Mr. Smith called Madoqua aside, and informed him of a special assignment that awaited
        him. He looked the driver-guide straight in the eye, and said with a firm and purposeful tone,
        “Robert is a great friend and we go back a long way. I have known him since we were two kids
        growing up in Edinburgh,” Mr. Smith said. “His family is here on vacation, and are visiting
        Tanzania this weekend. He is scheduled to go back to Scotland on Monday, and I want to ensure
        that he has a great time here. He loves the African wilderness, but has a special fascination
        for Rhinos. Remember, that he is not just a customer, but our esteemed guest. I want you to
        ensure that he has a great time in the Serengeti. I am confident that you will do a great
        job with this.” Saying so, he patted reassuringly on Madoqua’s shoulder and left. Mr. Smith
        was a laconic man and rarely did he lavish more than the most necessary detail. Moreover,
        special assignments were reserved for the more experienced guides, and it was widely known
        that the rewards for executing them successfully were bountiful. Madoqua drew in a long breath
        and sighed, as he realized the importance of the opportunity that lay ahead of him. He looked
        up the assignment and saw that his guests for next weekend were Robert Patterson, his wife
        Emily and their teenager son, Geoffry.
      </p>

      <p>
         *****
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="verse">“Jambo, jambo bwana,<br>
        Habari gaani, myzri sana”</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        Madoqua’s voice rang out to his passengers as the Land Cruiser rumbled along the moist track.
         Madoqua often taught his passengers these Swahili lines of a popular Kenyan tune, and they
        were usually echoed with great enthusiasm. Today, however, he noticed that only Geoffry responded,
        rather mechanically. Seated beside him was Robert Patterson, who donned a safari jacket with
        a rhino print, and looked rather glum. It was Saturday evening, and the safari had been a
        washout until then. The trip in the morning had been cancelled due to rain, and there were
        not too many animals to sight that evening. Sighting animals on a safari tended to depend
        a little on luck, and there were days when the most skilled of guides had to contend with
        sightings that could be disheartening to their guests. Madoqua had carefully planned the route
        he would take for this journey, factoring for the time of the year and the rhinocerous haunts
        that he was familiar with. However, the morning’s rain had upset all these calculations, leaving
        him frustrated. He slowed the vehicle down, as he approached a thicket, and noticed some movement
        within.
      </p>

      <p>
        “A pair of dik-diks. These antelope don’t need to drink water, and have highly efficient digestive
        systems that get all the water they need from the food and the dew drops they consume,” he
        stated. “Humans are the greatest threat to dik-diks”, he continued. “They are hunted for their
        skin, out of which gloves are made. It requires the skin of an entire dik-dik to make a single
        glove.” Madoqua punctuated the statement with a pause. Whenever he spoke about poachers, a
        feeling of disgust filled him. Madoqua hated the poachers. Madoqua held that the expanses
        of the Serengeti were the purest and most primeval form of beauty known to mankind. Poachers
        were vile beasts who could stab at this beauty with their knives, without as much as batting
        an eyelid in their greedy pursuit of wealth. In Madoqua’s opinion, this made them the most
        inhumane of people. However, it seemed as though his passengers today couldn’t care less about
        these sentiments as his words were met only with a cold silence, as the wheels of the Land
        Cruiser rumbled along.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over the course of the safari, Madoqua had realized that Mr. Patterson’s obsession with rhinocerous
        bordered on the fanatical. This was quite unlike any other passenger he had seen, and it seemed
        as though the rest of the African jungle and its spectacular embellishments were only secondary
        in Mr. Patterson’s eyes. In recent times, rhinocerous spotting had been rare, owning to heavy
        poaching. Furthermore, the shy animals retreated to the remote depths of the jungle during
        the rainy season. “I will try my best to see that we get a good view of a rhinocerous and
        her baby that I have spotted lately”, Madoqua had told Mr. Patterson when they had started
        their trip. Presently, the sky turned orange, and this meant that Madoqua had to turn his
        vehicle back to the resort and end that day’s safari, flustered that his meticulous preparation
        had to yield to the vagaries of the jungle.
      </p>

      <p>
        The onset of sleep, which was usually spontaneous, had evaded Madoqua that night, as he lay
        contemplating in bed. His colleagues were jealous of his quick rise through the ranks, and
        his current assignment would result in his further alienation from their lot. His thoughts
        also went to his family. Madoqua’s life was always alternating between his house and his time
        on the road. During his time away, he sorely missed his little daughter and his wife. His
        mind then flitted away to his dreams of securing his own independence. Land Cruisers were
        expensive! He knew a couple of places where he could get good deals for a second hand piece,
        but the price was still a tall ask in a country like Tanzania. He thought about how the pursuit
        of buying his own vehicle had consumed him in recent times. The clear relationship that effort
        shared with reward in his profession kept Madoqua motivated. He would always push harder to
        keep getting better – going the extra mile to please his customers, being available at a time
        when there was a scarcity of drivers, and working ceaselessly for special incentives. However,
        all of this came at a price. There had been occasions during the last tourist season when
        he had not returned home for three months at a time. There was a lingering tension in the
        household when he did return, due to his prolonged absence. At times, he would notice that
        his little daughter had grown significantly during his time away. These were drawbacks that
        Madoqua was aware of, but he justified them in the face of the rewards that his job brought.
         He fell asleep, dreaming of him singing Jambo Bwana, his daughter echoing this tune, riding
        behind him in the Land Cruiser, and a rhinocerous joining the chorus from alongside the road.

      </p>

      <p>
        The next morning, Madoqua spotted a serval - a wild cat with cloudy spots that required his
        expert eyes to spot it as it lay camouflaged in the grassy background. Servals, majestic cats
        that looked like miniature cheetahs, were nocturnal, and it was only in the early morning
        hours that one had the remote chance of spotting them. Madoqua had also led the Pattersons
        to a pride of lions that was perched on a tree. Lions are not the most natural tree climbers,
        and this was a rare sighting. In the evening, the group had spotted a large herd of hippos,
        basking in the evening’s sun alongside crocodiles, their friendly neighbours. Nevertheless,
        none of these sightings particularly excited Mr. Patterson. Despite all of his preparations,
        it seemed as though destiny had dealt Madoqua a sore blow. To make matters worse, another
        guest at the resort where the Pattersons had lodged overnight, had seen a rhino and her calf,
        the previous evening. Dusk was descending fast on yet another fruitless trip, and it was soon
        time to return. All of a sudden, Madoqua’s radio unit crackled to life.
      </p>

      <p>
        “There has been a rhino spotting about 30 km away, near a giant baobab tree,” the driver-guide
        quipped, and for the first time during their trip, Mr. Patterson’s eyes lit up. Madoqua revved
        the vehicle up and started in the direction of the rhino. His heart beat faster, as he saw
        a glimmer of hope appear before him. This trip could end well, after all. It was not going
        to be simple as it was already the late hours of dusk, and he needed to move fast. Madoqua
        sped his vehicle up to 50 km/hr - the maximum speed that vehicles in the reserve were permitted
        to travel.
      </p>

      <p>
        About halfway through, he quickly glanced at his watch, and realized that the time was 5:45
        PM. The remaining distance to the rhino would take about twenty minutes, and then there was
        the time Mr. Patterson would spend admiring the rhino. 6:30 PM was the cutoff time for all
        vehicles to be back at the resort, and the forest guards would be on the prowl for interlopers.
         If caught, Madoqua could be prohibited from driving in the jungles for a year and face a
        heavy fine. Madoqua was bothered by these thoughts as the Land Cruiser sped along the jeep
        track towards the rhinocerous.
      </p>

      <p>
        Madoqua thought about the route ahead, and the unforgiving timeline that was closing in on
        him. He should have glanced at his watch before announcing the rhino sighting to his guests,
        but now it was too late. He mulled whether he could go a little faster, and increased his
        speed. He was deeply familiar with the route to the rhinocerous, and the path was mostly a
        straight road. He was an expert driver, and had occasionally strayed, within bounds, past
        the speed limit. At about 10 km left, Madoqua and party were cruising along at 70 km/hr. His
        eyes were fixated and focused on the road ahead of him, and he was now oblivious to the reading
        on the speedometer.
      </p>

      <p>
        About 5 more kilometers left, and the lone, giant baobab tree appeared next to the roadside,
        close to the horizon. The radio unit crackled again to inform them that the rhino was beginning
        to retreat into the jungle, away from the path. They were so nearly there! At the very least,
        they deserved at least a glimpse or two of the retreating rhinos. Madoqua knitted his eyebrows
        and could see the giant baobab draw closer, his eyes now fixated on the destination rather
        than the straight path that led them there. In a flash, something appeared to move across
        the path ahead of him, taking him by surprise, and as soon as Madoqua’s eyes sensed this motion,
        he jammed hard on the brakes. An animal whizzed past the vehicle, barely escaping to its right.
         However, there was a small clunk, and the vehicle skidded to a halt, exposing another creature,
        writhing behind them on the pathway. Madoqua turned back to glance over the vehicle and saw
        a dik-dik lying on the road. He got out of the vehicle and rushed to its side. With every
        passing second though, Madoqua realized that nothing could survive the impact of the blow
        the vehicle had dealt the hapless creature.

        Madoqua picked up the little antelope in his arms, as he saw it convulsing. Several visions
        flashed in his head – of his childhood, running along paths in the shrub, the injured dik-dik
        he had nursed smearing its tears on the walls, Mr. Odumbaya’s wise smiling face when he showed
        him his degree in African tourism, and the vile look on the face of a poacher who was once
        arrested in his village. Madoqua held his temples with his large palms, as he shook his head
        in disbelief – his reality had been irrevocably altered in that fateful minute. A short distance
        away, the overrun antelope’s mate called out helplessly in characteristic shrill yelps. The
        big man lay the antelope on a grassy mound by the wayside. The Pattersons looked on as he
        knelt down beside it and wept loudly like a child.
