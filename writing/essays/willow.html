      <p>
        One consequence of living abroad while having friends and family who are scattered around 
        the world is that you tend to fall out of touch. It also doesn't help that I don't use much social media.
      </p>
      <p>
        To solve this problem, I built a simple tool that serves only two purposes:
        <ul>
          <li>reminding me to get in touch with people I have not spoken to in a while</li>
          <li>maintaining notes of past conversations</li>
        </ul>
        I call it <a href="https://willowdb.net">Willow</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>What's under the hood?</h3>
      <p>
        Willow employs Flask, a simple Python web framework, and is completely server-side rendered. 
        Contacts and interactions are stored in simple SQLite databases. On the front-end, I use HTML
        templating with Jinja2, which ships with Flask. The styling is all CSS. The app is hosted on
        Hetzner Cloud. I used pytest for unit tests and Playwright for website tests.
      </p>
      <h3>What did the process look like?</h3>
      <p>
        Building the app was a great learning experience. It started as a suggestion from a friend, who had built
        a similar app for his own use. I then used <a href="https://www.appsmith.com/">Appsmith</a>, a low code 
        front-end builder to build a working prototype. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I then started building the app out using Flask and a lot of help from ChatGPT. Initial progress
        was rapid, but I soon had to resort to hacks that I was ashamed off. I then realized that I needed 
        some code refactoring. When I tried to write some unit tests, I realized that my code wasn't modular 
        enough to test properly.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I started off with some website tests using Playwright and used them as a basis for refactoring my code. 
        I was then able to write unit tests as well. I then proceeded from hurdle to hurdle - from authentication to 
        database to server deployment. All of this was new to me, so I ended up learning a tonne of stuff. 
      </p>
      <h3>What is next?</h3>
      <p>
        The application is still lacking some basic features, such as mobile responsiveness, registration and password reset.
        They will be out soon. However, the core functionality is ready. I have been using it for a few weeks now and it 
        serves my needs well. I have also shared it with a few friends for beta testing. Write to me if you would like to 
        try it out.
