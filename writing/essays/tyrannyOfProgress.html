        <h2>The Tyranny of Progress</h2>

        <p>
        We live in the 21st century — at the very pinnacle of human progress. Just 150 years back,
        average life expectancy in the world was 30 years, compared to 72 years today. Less than 10
        percent of humanity lives in extreme poverty. Average income in the world, which stood at
        $2.80 in 1800 is around $40 today. We have never lived in a more peaceful and plentiful world.
         In the bargain we have abolished slavery and installed democratic governments in most parts
        of the world. Technology helps us achieve in a day what our predecessors did only through
        years of labour. We have physical and virtual robots to do our bidding, running on microprocessors
        that double in speed every 18 months, at a rate faster than Gordon Moore predicted in 1965.
        </p>

        <p>
        And yet, our lives get busier with every passing year. We are hurtling forward at a pace that
        is much faster than we ever have. In the 150,000 years of the existence of our species on
        the planet, we spent about 138,000 years (92%) as hunter gatherers. Tribes of hunter gatherers
        living today in the inhospitable Kalahari Desert work for 35–45 hours per week — a number
        that includes hunting once in three days, and gathering food for three to six hours every
        day. The rest of the time, they indulge in leisure — playing with their children, gossiping
        and telling each other stories. Foragers living in less harsh areas of the world would have
        likely had even more leisure. Our oldest ancestors certainly enjoyed a more leisurely lifestyle.
        </p>

        <p>
        We don’t need to go back 12,000 years to see this trend repeat. It is estimated that labourers
        in 13th to 16th century England <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/rauch/worktime/hours_workweek.html" target="_blank">
        worked for about 30 hours a week</a>, with plenty of breaks in
        the day and with more than 150 days of leisure. The only time in human history when we definitely
        worked longer hours than today was at the height of the Industrial Revolution in the mid-nineteenth
        century, when industrial workers worked for about 70 hours a week. The standard 40-hour work
        week that we find in today’s affluent countries is a mere return to pre-industrial levels
        of work.
        </p>

        <p>
        But before we compare ourselves with ancient foragers or medieval peasants, we must take into
        account all other forms of work in our daily lives. The average person in the US commutes
        for about half an hour one-way, so that adds up to an additional 5 hours of commute per week.
         We dedicate about 1.25 hours of work per day to household chores of cooking, cleaning, paying
        bills and keeping things in order, which involves about 9 more hours of work per week. In
        total, our work week including all the little tasks that fill up our lives adds up to around
        54 hours. In the developing world, professional work alone can account for 60–80 hours a week.
         Besides, several world leaders pride themselves on working long hours. At a commencement
        speech at the University of Southern California, Elon Musk exhorted graduates to work 100
        hours a week if they wished to start their own companies.
        </p>

        <p>
        Why are we <em>still</em> so busy?
        </p>

        <p>
        Despite the enormous progress we have achieved, we are busy creatures plagued by the persistent
        need to work long hours on a variety of jobs that leave us feel meaningless. If we have progressed
        so much on different fronts — economic, technological, social and cultural, why has our quality
        of work and the quantity of our leisure not seen substantial improvement? If we can get things
        done more efficiently, where does our time disappear? How does this happen to every generation?
        Why does an invisible hand seem to prod each of us to run faster than our predecessors? These
        questions have plagued me for a long time. The objective of this essay is to gather my findings
        from different places and summarize them.
        </p>

        <p>
        Through the course of this essay, I use several examples that are based in the United States
        of America. But their implications are more widespread in today’s globalized world.
        </p>

        <h3>The genesis of progress</h3>
        <p>
        The Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert asserts that ‘The human being is the only animal that
        thinks about the future.’ He considers this ability the crowning glory of our species — something
        that no other animal is capable of. He explains how this is made possible due to a recent
        evolution in our brain called the frontal lobe. This appendage of grey, wrinkled tissue that
        we developed over the course of the last 2–3 million years was the last part of the human
        brain to evolve. It enables human beings to be the only animals that care about our future
        selves, and sacrifice our today for the benefit of tomorrow. The long arm of our projections
        reaches out to frontiers that lie well beyond our eventual graves. We care about the lives
        of our unborn children and worry about the legacy that we would leave them behind. We believe
        in an after-life and write science fiction stories that project forward for decades, centuries
        and millennia after our ephemeral existence on the planet.
        </p>

      <p>
        <q>The human brain, it has been written, is an ‘anticipation machine, and ‘making future’ is
        the most important thing it does</q> — Daniel Dennet
      </p>

        <p>
        The frontal lobe also helps us simulate experiences before we even have them. This enables
        us to smile as we think about our upcoming vacation to Bali or frown when we think about a
        dental appointment next week. This is also why we don’t have to make onion flavoured ice-cream
        or put mayonnaise in our tea to know that either of those brave experiments would end in disaster.
         No other brain in the animal kingdom comes with the power to simulate an experience. Squirrels
        bury nuts and bees gather honey for the winter not through conscious decisions in their brains,
        but through programs that are burnt into their genes. Among humans, saving for the future
        is a subjective choice. Therefore, we see such a wide difference in attitudes towards saving
        among different cultures, with people in nations such as Singapore and Ireland saving more
        than 50% of their income, even as people in the United States and the United Kingdom save
        less than 20%.
        </p>

        <p>
        However, the ability to simulate future experiences is a recent feature that we have evolved
        — we still need to learn how to do it accurately. When people daydream about the future, they
        imagine themselves to succeed rather than fail. Students in the US believe that they would
        live longer, have longer marriages and make trips to Europe more often than real world averages.
         They dream of owning homes and having gifted children while underestimating the likelihood
        of having heart attacks, being involved in auto accidents or having a drinking problem. Most
        large projects plans are optimistic and invariably overshoot their budgets and their schedules.
         More often than not, our simulations of the future turn out to be wrong. They inflate our
        expectations, and when reality pays a visit at a later date, we are scrambling to live up
        those expectations, much like a company that promises 25% annual growth to its investors and
        slaves away for the rest of the year to meet that goal.
        </p>

        <p>
        Now let us digress to explore one of two turning points in human history. In the 138,000 years
        we spent as foragers, the future was much the same as the present was. The to-do list for
        a typical forager was:
        <ul>
          <li>Hunt</li>
          <li>Gather</li>
          <li>Eat</li>
          <li>Socialize</li>
          <li>Repeat</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        Our tendency to project into the future served us well during these periods. A life of hunting
        and gathering was simple, with predictable routines. But simple isn’t the same as easy. Every
        person in those dangerous times had to be equipped with the skills to survive in the wild.
         A toothache or a bleeding cut could be lethal. Nevertheless, their lives were simple because
        tomorrow was likely to be quite the same as today and life moved at a walking pace with each
        person possessing fewer belongings as we take on a typical day-hike.
        </p>

        <p>
        When we discovered agriculture, we fundamentally changed how we perceived the future. While
        food supply in a hunter gatherer’s life was dictated by day-to-day chance, growing crops gave
        us the promise of securing our rations. It is true that the crops we grew were at the mercy
        of several forces that we did not control — such as the weather, soil conditions, diseases,
        rampages from pests and pilferage from wild-animals. But we had the choice to do something
        about several of these factors, such as weeding our crops, planting in regions with stable
        climates and fencing off our field against animals. In these early agrarian days, the human
        idea of ‘planning’ was born. Our ancestors had to now make several decisions that would have
        implications on our future — the choice of crops to grow, the location of farms, cropping
        seasons, optimal levels of watering, identifying pests and weeds and so on. With the advent
        of planning, our lives transformed from ‘living for the here and now’ to ‘living for tomorrow’.
        </p>

        <p>
        But a control over the future did not mean that our lives improved. In fact, the opposite
        happened in early agrarian societies. A tribe of hunter-gatherers was egalitarian, where every
        individual enjoyed a better standard of life than the average peasant in a primitive agricultural
        society. Hunter gatherers put their mental faculties to good use in a variety of complex situations
        (hunter gatherers had <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28548397" target="_blank">
        bigger brains</a> than a modern human and were probably smarter on average).
        On the other hand, an agrarian life was hierarchical, with a handful of people at the top
        reaping the benefits of the back-breaking labour of the majority. Besides, a peasant’s life
        in 10,000 BC did not demand much imagination. He had to spend most of his day carrying pails
        of water and tending to his crops. His work became more mundane, and his living conditions
        deteriorated as he moved from expansive grasslands to crowded settlements. Life-expectancy
        plummeted and early peasants developed several diseases from back-breaking labour, unhygienic
        living conditions and exposure to farm animals. As our settlements grew larger and more crowded,
        this trend continued to worsen. The life of a peasant in 8000 BC was, on average, far worse
        than one who lived in the same region in 10,000 BC.
        </p>

      <p>
        <q>The human collective knows far more today than did the ancient bands. But at the individual
        level, ancient foragers were the most knowledgeable and skillful people in history.</q> — Yuval
        Noah Harari
      </p>

      <p>
      So why did we continue to suffer this degradation? Why did the peasant not throw up his hands
      and return to the woods and resume a life of hunting and gathering? This is due to an inherent
      tension that we faced as a species — between the power of the collective and the welfare of
      the individual. As a collective, an agrarian lifestyle gave us some measure of control over
      our destinies. It enabled people to specialize in different crafts, create better weapons,
      raise armies and protect their boundaries. If a tribe of hunter gatherers, which was on average
      less than 50 people strong, threatened to attack a village with 10,000 inhabitants on their
      territory, they stood no chance. So they were gradually sidelined to more inhospitable terrains
      as agrarians colonized the most fertile parts of the world. With increasing size came increasing
      collective power and a shinier promise of a better tomorrow, which never really arrived for
      most people. By the time they realized this bluff, their lifestyles had already changed and
      they could not go back to living how they had 30 years in the past. Does this promise not
      continue to ring true today? Does it not echo how despite improving on every objective collective
      metric, our sense of subjective well-being cannot catch up?
      </p>

      <p>
      I led us down this digression to make a few points:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Our brains are the only ones that can synthesize a future, but our predictions are often
          wrong by virtue of being too optimistic</li>
        <li>Limited control over the future is a double-edged sword</li>
        <li>In the long-run, collective power takes precedence over individual well-being</li>
        <li>We are descended of peasants who were bluffed into sacrificing today for the promise
        of a better tomorrow</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      For the longest time in our existence, we knew nothing other the present. Around 12,000 years
      ago, the ability to synthesize a future and a partial ability to control it set a treadmill
      into motion. Every bit of scientific or technological advancement gives us a little more control
      over our destinies. The goal of the human race as a collective is to try and make this control
      absolute. All our advancements through the centuries hint at this — to provide every member
      of society a structured education and predictable employment, to produce the most amount of
      cheap goods for a given amount of resource, to increase life expectancy and eradicate epidemics.
       Each step of the way, we get better at defying our destinies. We term anything that helps
      us advance towards this overarching goal of absolute control as ‘progress’. Every generation
      does its bit to get us a little further towards this goal. We all inherit this treadmill at
      a faster pace than our predecessors did and we, in turn, accelerate it for our successors.
       The biggest trick the devil ever pulled is to convince us that tomorrow would be better than
      today.
      </p>

      <p>
      Along this journey, we have already explored one turning point — where we transformed ourselves
      from a species of hunter gatherers to a race of settlers. Let us now explore the second turning
      point, where we put our belief in the future on steroids.
      </p>

      <h3>The plot thickens</h3>
      <p>
      Why does a bank lend so freely today?
      </p>

      <p>
      Capitalism is the dominant economic system in the world today. Capital is defined as wealth
      that is set aside for the purpose of generating more wealth. Most capital is generated by
      borrowing from investors. Banks are the easiest source of large sums of capital today. But
      why does a bank lend money so freely? This wasn’t always the case. About 500 years back, few
      banks existed, and most people were pessimistic about the future. So, they did not lend money
      as generously as banks do today. The ability to extend credit requires a firm belief in the
      future. Unless we believed that the future would be better than the present, we would not
      lend money to an entrepreneur who starts a new business. Every business is built on the premise
      of solving a problem today that makes tomorrow better, in exchange for profit. In the absence
      of that promise, no new business can be founded and nobody would lend anybody else money.
      </p>

      <p>
      Obtaining capital has never been easier than it is today. That is also because our belief
      in a better future has never been stronger. The manner in which our banks lend money illustrate
      this fact. A bank in the US is allowed to lend $10 for every $1 that it has in cash. If a
      bank has cash worth $1 million on its accounts, it is allowed to lend up to <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reservereq.htm" target="_blank">
      $10 million in loans</a> purely based on the trust that this $ 1 million that is lent out will multiply in a
      propitious future. The US government continues to spend more dollars than it collects as revenues
      from taxes and duties, in the hope that growth in the future would offset extravagance in
      the present. In 2018, the US spent $4.11 trillion in its annual budget, while having an income
      of only $3.30 trillion. The cumulative debt the US government owes to its public is $15.8
      trillion — a loan that the US has essentially taken against its own future. While the monetary
      policies of several countries are not as optimistic as that of the US, the world and its globalized
      economy lays a high degree of trust on future progress. Of course, this trust in the future
      isn’t always prudent. That is why, every other decade we run into a global financial crisis
      that punishes us for our optimism. But it is only a matter of time before we recover, redouble
      our faith in progress and march on.
      </p>

      <p>
      As we already know by now, the promise of a better future comes with a heavy price that is
      often hidden from our present.
      </p>

      <p>
      Due to the demands of the economic system that keeps our economies afloat, progress goes from
      being optional to mandatory. Countries now need to grow their GDP at a compounded rate to
      finance their burgeoning national debts. The world GDP is expected to <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/global-economic-prospects" target="_blank">
      grow 2.6% this year</a>.
      Given its meteoric rates of debt, The US economy is is required to grow 3–4% every year.
      While this percentage may not seem like much, for a country with an economy as large as the
      United States, it represents an annual GDP growth of about $144 billion. The growth necessary
      for developing countries can be even higher — at 5% to 7%. Several nations grow today not
      because they choose to, but because they have to. If the US stops growing for a few years
      and cannot service its interest payments, its creditors will demand to have their money back
      and its economy would collapse. Further, the influence of such a collapse will be felt everywhere
      in the world. Due to globalization and international trade, a policy decision taken in one
      part of the world often impacts the rest of the world. Almost every nation felt the ripples
      of the US sub-prime lending crisis of 2008. As the world’s largest economy, when the US sets
      the terms for international trade and economic cooperation, the rest of the world is forced
      to follow in step like a marching band.
      </p>

      <p>
      So how does this affect us as individuals? Well, those national economies are comprised of
      individual enterprises which also need to grow at a better rate than the average every single
      year — the same companies that employ us in droves. This need manifests as ambitious annual
      growth targets towards which every public corporation is expected to report on a quarterly
      basis. Even as the GDP is expected to grow at 3–7% a year, these companies have targets that
      are more ambitious in a race to outdo each other and earn a larger share of the market. In
      fact, several of our most valuable corporations prioritize growth even above the raison d’être
      of any private enterprise — profit. That leading companies in their respective markets such
      as Spotify, Tesla and Uber have never yet returned a dollar of profit indicates our fervent
      faith in the future. These technological startups are all built on the dreams of future earnings
      and the responsibility of realizing those dreams falls upon the shoulders of the employees
      of these firms.
      </p>

      <p>
      Further, this frantic need to grow exponentially raises an important question. Even as businesses,
      enterprises and nations, produce gargantuan amounts of goods and services, our real needs
      as individuals are limited. Sure, our material needs have certainly grown since we first wandered
      out of the jungles, but our basic needs haven’t grown at the same pace as our economies have.
       If GDP growth depends on burgeoning production of goods and services, who is going to consume
      them? Enter the magic wand of consumerism. Consumerism is the trick that the global economy
      pulls on every individual to compel them into consuming more than they really need. The minute
      we step outside our house or logon to the internet, advertisements tell us about all the myriad
      ways in which we can spend our money. Between the lines, those advertising slogans whisper
      to us how we are inadequate without buying those pair of jeans, watching the ‘biggest musical
      event in town’ or travelling to Sardinia for a vacation. Consumerism makes for a world of
      cruel irony best illustrated in how the rich today consume salads and smoothies, while the
      poor are afflicted by diseases of plenty such as heart disease, diabetes and cholesterol.
      Each year, people in the US spend more money on diets than the amount needed to feed all the
      hungry people in the rest of the world. Obesity is a double victory for consumerism — firstly,
      to fatten people by having them consume in excess of their needs, and later sell them diets
      and medical remedies for the problems they face.
      </p>

      <p>
      <q> Under the economic system of [industrial society]… we find that a large supply of goods is
      produced irrespective of demand, and then a demand is artificially created for goods by means
      of clever advertisements.</q> — J.C. Kumarappa
      </p>

      <p>
      We now arrive at an interesting cross-road that technology presents in our lives. On the one
      hand technology helps us do more with less. Technology gets work done faster, with fewer resources
      and with higher quality. This tendency brings with it the promise of a more leisurely and
      idyllic lifestyle. And yet, our frantic lives anything but leisurely or idyllic. This is because
      of what technology enables behind the scenes. No force in human history has given us more
      control over the future than technology has. The better technology gets, the more trust we
      lay on the future, the easier it is to secure credit, the higher we are expected to grow and
      the faster we are forced to move. Most entrepreneurial ventures today are based on the use
      of technology to generate future profit, towards which banks and venture capitalists alike
      lend lavishly. Sure, the market makes corrections against our unfounded optimism like it did
      during the internet bubble of 2000. But the overall direction of this trend is clear — to
      surge forward with better technology, cheaper credit, higher growth targets and a faster life.
       In summary, the global economic system requires people to run on treadmills at an increasing
      pace — both as consumers and producers. While technology enables us to run faster, it surreptitiously
      increases the speed of the treadmills on which we are running as well.
      </p>

      <p>
      As we have seen before, the global economic system requires us to be voracious producers (as
      employees) and buyers (as consumers) to stay afloat. Let us explore both these roles and their
      problems in more detail.
      </p>

      <h3>The worship of consumption</h3>

      <p>
      The problem of consumption is an old one and all old problems have old solutions. Stoic philosophers,
      who date back to the ancient Greek and Roman empires, often guarded us against the perils
      of consumerism. Once every month, the stoics, who often had access the highest standards of
      living in ancient Greek and Roman society, deliberately restricted themselves to the barest
      of necessities for a few days. In those days, they volunteered to live the life of a poor
      person. In a bid to understand what was most essential to their lives, they stripped themselves
      of the superficial and fleeting joy that consumption of material objects brought to their
      lives. In the process, they learnt not to be fearful of poverty. They realized how a life
      of penury wasn’t as bad as their imagination would have them believe. They advocated a deep
      understanding of what simple living meant.
      </p>

      <p>
      <q> Set aside a certain number of days, during which you shall be content with the scantiest and
      cheapest fare, with coarse and rough dress, saying to yourself the while: ‘Is this the condition
      that I feared?’</q> — Seneca the Elder
      </p>

      Another source of inspiration takes us to Henry David Thoreau’s small cabin in the woods off
      the city of Concord, Massachusetts in the United States. In 1860, at a time when the Industrial
      Revolution was at its peak, Thoreau found himself disillusioned with modern life. Thoreau
      lamented how work and consumption was taking over people’s lives and wished to restrict his
      material needs to the barest of essentials so that he can dedicate all his remaining time
      and attention to his spiritual pursuits. At the age of 28, Thoreau removed to a pond in the
      woods where he built himself a simple cabin by hand for a mere $28.5 (less than $1000 in today’s
      money). In that cabin, he proceeded to live as simply as he could for about two years. Thoreau
      wished to find out how much work it really took to live with life’s simplest necessities.
      Throughout his stay in the cabin, he kept stringent accounts of every dollar he spent and
      ever hour he worked. He concluded that he needed to work for only one day a week and could
      devote the remaining six days to spiritual pursuits of exploring the woods, connecting with
      nature and writing.
      </p>

      <p>
      <q> I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts
      of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover
      that I had not lived.</q> — Henry David Thoreau
      </p>

      <p>
      To put that in perspective, when the people of his time were slaving away for 60 hours or
      more in factories, Thoreau needed only a day of labour to work for a respectable sustenance.
       He mentioned how people seldom thought why they had to work so hard, or whether they needed
      that latest widget in their homes. Thoreau asked that we account everything we bought in terms
      of how much ‘life’ it took away from us. One might save two hours by travelling to town in
      a horse-drawn carriage instead of walking. But to be able to own and maintain that carriage
      for the trip might require the wages from an entire day of labour. In Throeau’s manner of
      accounting, walking is more efficient despite being slower. Sure, horse-drawn carriages are
      fast and Venetian blinds are pretty. But even as people toiled hard to be able to afford them,
      they didn’t often think about what their material possessions took away from their lives.
      </p>

      <p>
      The stoics and Thoreau, through their lives and teachings, demonstrate to us how we can live
      a full life in the absence of material excess. This ethic repeats itself in every major religion
      in the world. Buddhist philosophy tells us that the aim of all natural beings is to maximize
      their own well-being while minimizing the consumption of material resources. Mother nature
      is parsimonious. And yet, in modern times, we have inverted this logic by seeking to maximize
      material consumption even at the cost of well-being of our species and the planet. Contemporary
      research shows us how this isn’t working. In 1993, the psychologist <a href="http://www.davidmyers.org/davidmyers/assets/Pursuit.Happ.scientific%20american.pdf" target="_blank">
      David G. Myers</a> demonstrated how having more money does not necessarily bring about greater subjective well-being. His
      calculations show that although the adjusted value of after-tax personal income in the United
      States has more than doubled between 1960 and 1990, the percentage of people describing themselves
      as ‘very happy’ has remained unchanged at around 30%.
      </p>

      <p>
      A culture of rampant consumption is a newfangled idea. Our culture qualifies individuals solely
      on the basis of their material wealth. Every day we report on the ‘net-worth’ of our wealthiest
      individuals. Such a concept — a feature of the last 100 years — would have been preposterous
      in every era of the past. In 1970, the Swedish economist <a href="https://home.ubalt.edu/tmitch/642/articles%20syllabus/csikszentmihalyi%20so%20rich.pdf" target="_blank">
      Staffan B. Linder</a> demonstrated how
      a person who only responds to material rewards loses the ability to derive happiness from
      other sources. He wrote how ‘the struggle for affluence has created a harried leisure class,
      a nation of materialistic status-seekers so overestimated in the pursuit of wealth that the
      primary pleasures of life — love, family, community, physical pleasure and so on, increasingly
      elude them.’ The accumulation of material wealth shares several parallels with addiction.
      Like an addiction, the accumulation of material wealth enhances one’s standard of life at
      first. Therefore, individuals assume that more of it must be a good thing. But our needs constantly
      increase in step with the dosage and like most things, whatever is good in a small measure
      can often turn out to be harmful to us in larger quantities.
      </p>

      <p>
      Historically, we have always celebrated frugality as the remedy to the problem of consumption,
      but modern society would have none of it. John Kenneth Galbraith had identified the major
      reason for the world’s silence with regard to consumption — the ideological ‘worship of the
      Great God Growth’. Any device or regulation that interfered with the supply of more and better
      things is resisted ‘with unreasoning horror, as the religions resist blasphemy, or the warlike
      pacifism’. Neither the stoics, nor Thoreau are as widely celebrated as Kim Kardashian or Justin
      Bieber today. Minimalists are branded hipsters, new-agey and called other names that sideline
      them from mainstream society. This is only because the constructs of mainstream society would
      duly collapse if we all lived simply. As individuals, though, if this world-view does not
      work for us, we have the choice to do differently. It only requires us to examine the fundamental,
      yet hidden truths based on which modern society functions.
      </p>

      <p>
      <q> I am convinced, both by faith and experience, that to maintain one’s self on this earth is
      not a hardship but a pastime, if we live simply and wisely.</q> — Henry David Thoreau.
      </p>

      <p>
      Thoreau wrote how his most essential needs fit into four simple categories — food, clothing,
      shelter and fuel. Every other need was peripheral and could be minimized. But we do not need
      to go to a faraway cabin in Massachusetts to discover this ethic. It prevails among in the
      financial prudence that our religious texts command and most middle-class families enshrine
      in their simple living. It manifests as the anti-consumerist movements of minimalism and sustainable
      living that are sweeping the modern world. It is poetic that stoic philosophy is gaining prominence
      in Silicon Valley today, the veritable hub of our world’s culture of progress. As consumers,
      when you realize that $1,500 a month is sufficient for a comfortable life, while putting away
      $500 as savings, any job that offers a net salary of more than $2,000 a month does not have
      quite the same allure for you. Further, people wouldn’t jump at jobs that offer them four
      times what they need, while driving them to work 60 hours a week, which leads us to the next
      problem.
      </p>

      <h3>The progressive destruction of work</h3>
      <p>
      What goes into making a pin that holds sheets of paper together?
      </p>

      <p>
      The craft of pin making is more intricate than you may think. It involves eighteen different
      tasks including drawing the thin wire, straightening it, cutting it, pointing it and grinding
      the top. The head of the pin requires two or three distinct operations of its own. The head
      is then installed into the body, and the pin is whitened. All of this work goes into making
      a single diminutive pin — an intricate craft in itself. Back in the 1760’s, Adam Smith observed
      the manufacture of pins and mentioned how if one person were to do all these things from beginning
      to end, he would be, at most, able to make 20 pins a day. However, if the act of making these
      pin was sub-divided into 18 tasks, which were distributed among 10 men, they could produce
      more than 48,000 pins in a single day — a rate of about 4,800 pins per person.
      </p>

      <p>
      Such is the lure of division of labour, that it promises to multiply production to more than
      200 times its initial value. It benefits all of humanity to produce more pins and every other
      widget more efficiently through industrial means. As a collective, we stand to gain. But what
      do we lose in the trade-off? The fine and intricate art of crafting a pin is reduced to 18
      trifling tasks which involve little more than the mechanical and thoughtless movement of one’s
      limbs. With the establishment of pin-factories, it is no longer viable for blacksmiths to
      craft individual pins of different shapes and sizes. Homogeneity and standardization take
      the place of variety, as an intricate, hand-made craft is relegated to mindless work on an
      industrial assembly line. Here again, in our work-places we see the inherent tension between
      collective power and individual prosperity. Pope Pius XI quoted how factories improve dead
      matter, but in the bargain, subject men to corruption and degradation. By dividing labour,
      we have dehumanized work by shifting our focus to the goods rather than the people that produce
      them. Moreover, a system that produces pins cheaper and faster accrues more power and drives
      out competing enterprises.
      </p>

      <p>
      Fast forward to the 2000’s — more than 200 years after the advent of the Industrial Revolution.
       Our belief in the future is at an all-time high, reflected in growth targets for countries
      and companies alike. Most organizations are under the same pressure to grow exponentially
      in order to stay in step with the global economy does. The demands of capitalism ensure that
      a failure to embrace this trajectory of growth will see them out of business sooner rather
      than later. As employees of these organizations, their growth targets become our growth targets.
       All of this has a direct bearing on how our work is structured. Today, a college student
      who has never cooked a pack of instant noodles by himself can be trained to work at McDonald’s
      in a single day — to flip patties, make golden-brown french fries and serve customers a hot
      meal within 2 minutes of their placing an order. Our own roles within the companies for which
      we work are no different — it is just that our employer would perhaps need up to two months
      to replace us with another person or a piece of code, rather than the two days that McDonald’s
      needs.
      </p>

      <p>
      Work is viewed by the modern economy merely as a means for production. Economists categorize
      labour along with land and capital as a ‘factor of production’. From the employer’s view,
      labour is a cost to be eliminated through automation. We are brought up to view work as toil
      and drudgery that is not meant to by enjoyable. Ask a schoolchild the opposite of ‘work’,
      and without a second thought, she would answer ‘play’. Her teacher, and the world at large,
      teaches her that work and play are meant to be opposites. If play is enjoyable and fulfilling,
      work is meant to feel like drudgery. Even our language hints at this outlook, whereby employees
      are termed ‘human resources’. Work is seen as a dis-utility for which we are paid a ‘compensation’
      for our sacrifice. The dehumanization of work which started when we stopped hunting and gathering
      to settle down to toil in its fields has assumed industrial scale in the last two centuries.
      </p>

      <p>
        <q>The ideal point of view of the employer is to have output without employees, and the ideal from the point of
           view of the employee is to have income without employment.</q> — E.F. Schumacher
      </p>

      <p>
      But work plays a crucial role in our lives that we do not appreciate enough today. Buddhist
      philosophy understands work to serve three functions: to give people a chance to utilize and
      develop their faculties, enable them to overcome egocenteredness by teaming with others towards
      a common task and create the goods and services needed for a respectable existence. The Ghandian
      economist and philosopher. J.C. Kumarappa quotes ‘If the nature of work is properly appreciated
      and applied, it will stand in the same relation to the higher faculties as food is to the
      physical body. It nourishes and enlivens the higher man and urges him to produce the best
      he is capable of’. The economist E.F. Schumacher writes how organizing work in a manner that
      it becomes ‘meaningless, boring, stultifying, or nerve-racking’ for the worker indicates ‘a
      greater concern with goods than with people’. He further adds that to strive for leisure as
      an alternative to work is to fail to understand how work and leisure are complementary, and
      how separating them would mean destroying both the ‘joy of work and the bliss of leisure’.
      </p>

      <p>
      Yet, this dehumanization of work through division of labour and its demonization in our language
      are necessary for human progress. Consumerism goes hand-in-hand with this ethic of suffering
      at work and consuming in excess during periods of leisure. But as we already know, this only
      leaves us living through lives with a burning sense of emptiness. On looking back at our conventional
      careers, we all feel this sense of emptiness. The movie Fight Club bases its plot on this
      widespread feeling. And yet, we are encouraged to put our heads down and go back to work.
      20 years of formal education prepare us to run on this professional treadmill for 40 more
      years, while conditioning us into unquestioning obedience.
      </p>

      <p>
      Not all jobs are equally destroyed. Some professions still celebrate the creative potential
      of each of us as individuals, even while performing an economic function. As a rule of thumb,
      the larger the organization you are employed by, the smaller is the degree of autonomy you
      have. Your place in the hierarchy matters as well — managers and executives have higher responsibilities
      towards realizing their firm’s growth and economic targets than the individuals who report
      to them. Another useful axis to consider is whether the organization earns in the present
      or the future. Firms that are funded by their own profits have a greater degree of autonomy
      than the ones which grow rapidly in the hope of turning profitable in the future.
      </p>

      <p>
      As employees, the most effective means to get off the treadmill of progress is to be self-employed.
       Aldous Huxley mentioned how small scale or self-employment makes for ‘a more humanly satisfying
      life for more people, a greater measure of genuine self-governing democracy and a blessed
      freedom from the silly or pernicious adult education provided by the mass producers of consumer
      goods through the medium of advertisements.’ Being self-employed gives us the benefit of setting
      our own growth targets. It gives us some room to decide when we work, where we work and for
      whom we work. For most people, choosing to be self-employed was extraordinarily hard in the
      past. However, several paradigm shifts in the modern world has made it easier than ever to
      work for yourself. About fifty years ago, to start your own enterprise, you needed access
      to copious amounts of cheap capital. You needed to invest that in large machinery and hope
      that the stars align in your favour. Today, all you need is a laptop and an internet connection.
       The internet has already diminished transaction costs to allow people in the gig-economy
      to work as independent contractors. This phenomenon will only grow with the passage of time.
      </p>

      <p>
      Self-employment also lets us create organisations which can play by a different set of rules
      than the ones in the mainstream. This isn’t to say that people who are self-employed are immune
      to competition or the pressures of the market. But given those realities, self-employed professionals
      can choose to respond differently. Startups can choose to be bootstrapped — to not receive
      funding from outside and be in-charge of their own growth and revenue targets. Several organizations
      have managed to do this successfully. The tech company <a href="https://basecamp.com/welcome-back" target="_blank">
      Basecamp</a> offers a shining example.
      Contrary to most similar tech companies, Basecamp is self-funded and has few pre-defined goals
      and metrics. Its founders believe in enabling their teams to do their most fulfilling work
      within reasonable hours. During the summer months, the 50 odd employees at Basecamp work for
      as few as 32 hours a week. And most importantly, their founders design their workplace to
      ensure that work is something that people can enjoy on an everyday basis.
      </p>

      <p>
      Further, a life of frugality complements self-employment because of lower needs and less pressure
      to forego a fat, corporate paycheck. In a comprehensive study, the psychologist Daniel Kahneman
      and the economist Angus Deaton, proved how beyond a household income of $75,000 per year,
      increase in income has <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160305061814/http:/www.pnas.org/content/107/38/16489.full" target="-_blank">
      no co-relation to improvement in emotional well-being</a>. While that amount
      is far more than most people make in the world today, it is also far less than what most of
      us aspire to make in our professional lives.
      </p>

      <h3>Caveats</h3>

      <p>
      My first caveat is to mention how I do not believe capitalism to be evil. Capitalism is best
      employed in bringing progress to the parts of the world that need it the most — places where
      people have to worry about making ends meet every single day. Nor do I think that big corporations
      have bad intentions. From the days of the peasant who traded his life of hunting and gathering
      to settling on a farm, to the CEO who motivates and inspires her workers, we are all in search
      of a better future. Free-market capitalism rewards labour through profits and weeds out dishonesty
      and wastage through competition. I am all for compassionate capitalism, but not for capitalism
      for its own sake.
      </p>

      <p>
      Secondly, I mention self-employment as a viable alternative to a mind-numbing corporate job.
       Having said this, I do not imply that being self-employed is easy. To embark on that path,
      is to offer something to the world that is both rare and valuable — to serve an audience that
      is under-served and do it better than anybody has done it thus far. Unless you’re lucky, it
      takes several years of deliberate practice to offer something rare and valuable. While I have
      mentioned that it is easier today to embark on these pursuits than the past, this also means
      that several more people are vying for the same opportunity than a few years back. However,
      most of us fail to realize how this option is available and is becoming more accessible than
      we think. In order to become self-employed in a few years, now is the best time to start.
      </p>

      <p>
      Lastly, I don’t decry all progress. It is wonderful that we enjoy longer, more productive
      and more peaceful lives than any of our ancestors ever did. It is fantastic that as I sit
      down to write these words, I have to worry neither about where my next meal would come from,
      nor about the dishes that I have to do after consuming it. The benefits of this progress are
      apparent to all of us, and as a man who was born into a life of privilege, I enjoy its fruits
      more than most people around me do. But even as we sing the praise of progress in glorious
      gospels, its costs are conveniently hidden away from our view. Through this essay, I am only
      trying to make my small contribution towards rectifying that imbalance.
      </p>

      <h3>The treadmill of progress</h3>

      <p>
      As humans, our defining trait is our mind’s ability to project into the future. Given this
      is the most recent development in our brain, we still haven’t learnt to be accurate in our
      simulations of the future — our projections are invariably more optimistic than reality would
      allow.
      </p>

      <p>
      This tendency, scaled up to our global, interconnected world leads us to the spirit of our
      times — our discontent with the present and our urge to control the future. Even as our future
      on this planet is threatened, we seek to launch ourselves to other planets. Our grasp over
      our future lets us generate vast sums of capital, which are then employed into the production
      of goods and services through the use of cutting-edge technology. We are then persuaded to
      consume this produce with a voracity that keeps pace with the exponential rate at which we
      wish for our economy to grow and bolster our faith in our future. To keep this ambitious cycle
      going, society needs all the help it can muster. Therefore, it tries to recruit every member
      of our race that is possibly can to run on the treadmill of progress.
      </p>

      <img src="../../images/treadmillOfProgress.png" alt="A cycle that goes between Capital, Production and Belief in the Future">

      <p>
      This wasn’t a choice we made. Ever since our birth, we have been brought up and groomed to
      run on the treadmill of progress. Once this treadmill is visible to us, we are faced with
      a choice — to continue running like we always have, or get off and do something differently.
       But it is important to recognize that we are empowered with this choice. For the longest
      time, I wasn’t even aware of it. I wish somebody had broken this essay down into several lessons
      and taught it to me as a course in high-school. Understandably though, the only lessons we
      are taught in school are the ones that help us fit into society — not ones that encourage
      us to challenge its constructs.
      </p>

      <p>
      The choice we are given here is to redefine richness. The world defines richness in purely
      material terms. But richness is to maximize our well-being while minimizing our material needs.
       It is to design our work and leisure to make them enjoyable and fulfilling. It is to embrace
      the present moment rather than always hanker after an elusive future. In summary, to be rich
      is to enjoy every step of the journey rather than to suffer through life in pursuit of a promised
      land that will never come.
