        <p>
          October 2021 was a month filled with agony for my software development
          team. We found ourselves in a crisis that led us to some
          soul-searching.
        </p>

        <p>
          I work as part of a front-end focused team, which develops and hosts
          an E-commerce website for our client. I say 'front-end focused'
          because our backed is maintained by an external team, whose API our
          web application consumes. Shortly before October 2021, the backend
          team made a major change to this API, which sent our tests into a
          tizzy. 8 out of 10 of our end-to-end tests were red, and had to be
          painstakingly analysed, adapted and comforted. In most cases, the API
          didn't send the responses we expected. When it did, the response data
          weren't in the right format. Further, key test data were missing.
        </p>

        <p>
          The whole process felt like putting together a complex jigsaw puzzle,
          but with pieces that kept changing shape. The moment we solved one
          section of the puzzle, another section would get scrambled. Every
          corrected test was a piece forced back into place, and the whole month
          was a slow, painstaking effort to rebuild a familiar picture from a
          chaotic mess of ill-fitting parts.
        </p>

        <p>
          Out of morbid curiosity, we decided to measure how much pain this
          process caused us (in number of hours). The verdict took us all aback.
          It took us 172(!) hours to recover from a major update to the backend
          API. We then asked ourselves how many bugs or errors we had uncovered
          for the 172 hours we had invested. The answer was 1 bug. 1 measly
          dropdown that wasn't working as expected. The rest of the time was
          spent merely patching up wounds that had exposed our fragility to the
          external API. Something had to change.
        </p>

        <p>
          Today, we have come a long way with solving this problem. In Mar 2023,
          it took us merely 4 hours to recover from another backend overhaul.
          This progress motivated my colleague Vincent and me to share our
          learning. We told our story at the WeAreDevelopers 2023 conference in
          Berlin to a packed audience (see video above). This article reiterates
          what we narrated there.

        />

        <h3>The root cause</h3>

        <p>
          Since we were primarily a front-end team, we had extensive tests
          against our front-end. However, we had neglected testing the back-end
          API we consumed, since an external team owned it. This was a big
          mistake. We then realized that it was also our responsibility to test
          the backend API with an equal amount of rigour. Further, we needed to
          improve coordination and collaboration with the external backend team.
          Finally, we needed to make our software and tests robust to changes in
          their API environment.

        <div class="caption">

          lightning bolt indicates the pain we felt.
        </div>
        <p>
          This is an old problem in software development, and it has an old
          solution that goes by the name of Consumer Driven Contract Testing. An
          API contract is an agreement between an API provider (the external
          backend team) and an API consumer (us), which documents this API's
          behaviour. Our solution to this problem involved a three step process:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Validate contract</li>
          <li>Enforce contract</li>
          <li>Simulate contract</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These steps are sequential, and represent different levels of maturity
          . E.g. to successfully move to step 3, simulate contract, you need to
          have validated and enforced it earlier.
        </p>

        <h3>Setup</h3>
        <p>
          For our demos, we used
          <a href="https://fakestoreapi.com/">Fake Store API</a> as the test
          API. For writing the tests, we used
          <a href="https://github.com/karatelabs/karate">Karate DSL</a>, a
          versatile and user-friendly test framework that uses Gerkin like
          syntax. You can see all the demos in the video linked to this article.
          The code presented in the demo can be found in
          <a href="https://github.com/bitgrip/WAD-2023-contract-testing"
            >this Github repository</a
          >.
        </p>

        <h3>Validate contract</h3>
        <p>
          This step involves writing automated tests to ensure that the API is
          working as expected. We wrote these tests at three different levels of
          detail - status, schema and data.
        </p>
        <h4>Level 1. Validate status</h4>
        <p>
          We started off by writing tests that ensured if key endpoints were
          sending us the right response status. Since this was a red-green
          superficial check, we needed more.
        </p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/anupamck/528828ad8b1060e9562c6cb11f3252c4.js"></script>

        <h4>Level 2. Validate schema</h4>

        <p>
          We then moved on to also validating the response schema for these
          endpoints. We merely asserted the availability of specific keys while
          keeping their values generic. We did this so that our tests would not
          break even if the specific data delivered by the endpoints changed.
        </p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/anupamck/2e0131dcb87b5c6abded5d9a47b423a9.js"></script>
        <p>
          In the first scenario, we insist on each item of the response array to
          deliver an id that is a number, a title that is a string and so on.
          However, in certain cases, we needed to be even more specific, which
          leads us to level 3.
        </p>

        <h4>Level3. Validate data</h4>

        <p>
          In this level of validation, we dealt with cases where our front-end
          tests depended on specific data being delivered by the endpoint. Here
          we insisted on this data being delivered in the format that our tests
          expected them.
        </p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/anupamck/54419c01b334371e6f7f6ca87e4c31fc.js"></script>
        <p>
          In the first test scenario above, we insist on the 3rd product having
          the title 'Mens Cotton Jacket', and its price being 55.99.
        </p>
        <p>
          All these levels are cumulative, and together, they make for a robust
          layer of tests against the external API.
        </p>
        <p>A couple of best practices to note here:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Expected API response schema are best stored in a separate JSON
            file, so that they don't clutter up your tests.
          </li>
          <li>
            Specific data that your tests expect can be stored in a separate
            test data configuration file, which is then referenced across your
            tests. This way, if this data changes, you only need to modify one
            file.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>

          alt="Schematic diagram now has tests against the front-end and the external back-end API"
        />
        <div class="caption">
          Our schematic diagram now includes automated tests against the
          external API.
        </div>

        <p>
          The rule of thumb here is to write contract API tests for every
          endpoint that our front-end tests depend upon. This really speeds up
          the analysis of broken tests - if a front-end test fails and its
          corresponding API test has also failed, chances are that these are
          related.
        </p>

        <p>
          One thing you need to guard against is being too dogmatic. Remember
          that your objective is not to test the backend API in its entirity. It
          is to merely test that slice of the API that you depend upon. Merely
          test the endpoints that you consume. And merely test those key-value
          pairs in the schema that are relevant for your use. Only in
          exceptional cases will you need to test the values that accompany
          these keys.
        </p>

        <h3>Enforce contract</h3>

        <p>
          A contract is merely as good as its enforcement. For the longest time,
          we had defined our contract in the form of static documentation. Our
          external partner used a Swagger page to document the endpoint's
          behaviour. However, we knew with experience that this document grew
          outdated with time. It was a constant struggle to keep it in sync with
          the real API.
        </p>

        <p>
          At our end, we also documented test data in static tables in a
          Confluence document. This document also required constant work and
          tended to decay with time. We needed a better alternative.
        </p>

        <h4>"Use your code as contract"</h4>

        <p>
          In step 1, validate contract, we had already written detailed tests to
          ensure if a contract is working properly. We now realized that these
          API tests serve as a better definition for the contract than static
          documentation. With the first two levels of validation, these tests
          can describe an API's behaviour as well as any API document can. As
          for test data, this data can be conveniently captured in a test data
          configuration file that feeds into your tests.
        </p>

        <p>
          In effect, the API contract with your partner is fulfilled only if
          these tests are green. Our mantra - use your code as contract. That
          way, the contract's definition is dynamic and keeps pace with changes
          to the API it describes.
        </p>

        <p>
          But when your tests do invariably fail, how can you troubleshoot them?
        </p>

        <h4>Troubleshooting woes</h4>

        <p>
          Our approach was to ping our partner team via a shared messaging app.
          We would describe the problem in the chat window and throw some
          additional info across for debugging. In most cases, this information
          would not be adequate and they would request some more. Sometimes,
          they give us a solution that we don't understand. This exchange goes
          back-and-forth for hours, and sometimes for days, without the
          underlying problem being resolved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our solution to this problem was to share our tests with our external
          partner and have them test on our behalf. Now you might be skeptical
          of why an external team would be enthusiastic to run your tests. This
          is what we thought as well, until we suggested this to our partners
          and were pleasantly surprised when they agreed right away.
        </p>

        <p>
          This was when we realized that the pain we felt was also felt by our
          partner team. They weren't thrilled about being interrupted with
          debugging requests in the middle of important work. They also did not
          enjoy playing detective, to random clues we threw at them across a
          chat window. By sharing our API tests with our partners, we clearly
          communicated what we expected from their API. Further, we also gave
          them valuable information to debug and fix this problem.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, despite robust contract validation and enforcement, our
          front-end code still has a tight dependency on the backend API. When
          the API changed, it still broke our tests. Getting around this
          limitation is what we do in the third step of our process.
        </p>
        <h3>Simulate contract</h3>

        <p>
          <i>Disclosure - we are still working on this part of the problem.</i>
        </p>

        <p>
          With API mocking, you truly turn into the master of your domain. You
          are finally isolated from the entropy introduced by those erratic
          endpoints of your external partner. You can reset state changes as
          often as necessary and reuse the same test data. You can mock and test
          against endpoints that aren't available in the test environment due to
          security or other constraints.
        </p>

        <p>
          What's more? With new features, you no longer have to wait on
          endpoints to be delivered by the external team. Instead, you can
          simulate the behaviour of endpoints that do not exist yet and start
          developing new features against them.
        </p>

        <p>
          We started off by mocking our endpoints with Karate Netty, a feature
          offered by Karate, which served us well for simple endpoints.
        </p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/anupamck/bb8a7188a5274a80585d0d64dfb207b7.js"></script>

        <p>
          You can run this example with the following command:
          <code>
            java -jar karate-1.4.0.jar -m src/test/java/Simulate/users.feature
            -p 8081
          </code>
        </p>

        <p>
          However, mocking also comes with its own reality distortion field.
          With time, our mocked endpoints are sure to deviate from the real API,
          which can lead to catastrophic failures if ignored for long enough.
          Luckily, there is an easy solution to this problem. Those
          triple-layered contract tests can be run against both the mock
          endpoint and the real endpoint in quick succession. If both these test
          runs are green, your mock is in sync with the API. If one of these are
          red, a deviation has been detected. We demonstrate all of this in the
          video linked to this article (see above).
        </p>

        <img
          class="medium"
          src="../../images/e2ESetup3.png"
          alt="Schematic diagram has a mock server as a proxy between the external back-end API"
        />
        <div class="caption">
          The tight coupling with the backend server is now replaced by the
          loosely coupled mock server.
        </div>

        <p>
          One caveat here - avoid overengineering your mocks. Your mocks merely
          need to simulate enough of the API's behaviour to verify your own
          application. If you are simulating an endpoint that delivers an access
          token, you can have it deliver the same token each time against a
          dummy username and password. You don't need the behaviour to be a
          replica of the external endpoint - that would be a waste of effort.
          Your mocks need to merely pass your contract tests - nothing more.
        </p>

        <p>
          We soon realized that our use case was too complex to build with
          Karate Netty. We found
          <a href="https://wiremock.org/docs/standalone/"
            >Wiremock (standalone)</a
          >
          to be the most promising alternative here, which we are currently
          building out. Although these tools are different, the same principles
          apply.
        </p>

        <h3>Summary</h3>

        <p>
          Building software often involves working closely with external teams
          and consuming their services. These services are often foundational to
          the application we are building. Therefore, it is a mistake to
          abdicate the testing of these services entirely to the external teams
          that build them. Even when external teams do test their software, they
          are unlikely to do this from your perspective. The onus is on your
          team and you to constantly verify the stability of the foundation that
          your software is built upon.
