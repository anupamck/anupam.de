        <h2>What writing 1000 blogposts taught me</h2>
        <span class="date">Oct 2020</span>
        <p>
        On one cold January evening in 2018, I wrote a blogpost on an impulse. I then chose a simple
        WordPress theme and published that post. The next day, I wrote another post. The day after
        that, I wrote another. 1000 posts later, I find myself here.
        </p>

        <p>
        Growing up, I always thought of myself as a writer. I wrote my first poem in class 4, which
        was published out of kindness in the local newspaper. Throughout my schooling and university,
        I have been part of writing clubs. I wrote only when I found myself in the grip of an inspired
        moment. These moments had a will of their own, but they followed one pattern — whenever I
        put out a good post, the next one would take longer to arrive. People often complimented my
        writing, but I guarded those compliments closely by holding onto the dangerous myth of one
        being only as good as one’s last performance.
        </p>

        <p>
        Yet, even as my writing became sporadic to the point of non-existence, I continued to think
        of myself as a writer. At some point, this notion started to feel empty. You cannot call yourself
        a plumber, a carpenter or a surgeon for long if you idled away amidst your tools while waiting
        for inspiration to strike. While writers are veterans at this act of self-delusion, even inventing
        terms like ‘writer’s block’ by way of justification, a writer that does not write feels empty
        inside. You are what you do despite what you say you are.
        </p>

        <p>
        For the first time, I stopped calling myself a writer and decided instead to write everyday.
         I did not wish to merely write in private — I wanted the world to see my writing, and along
        with it, parts of my naked self. Striving for perfection in total secrecy is more than it
        is made out to be. It is harder, but more meaningful to publish your imperfect creations to
        the ruthless judgement of the world rather than protect them within the sanctuary of your
        own head.
        </p>

        <p>
        Most people think they are better writers than they actually are. It is, after all, a skill
        that we are taught right from primary school. But just pause to think about how writing actually
        works. The cerebral cortex of our brain has the surface area of two newspaper sheets that
        are that are folded in and squeezed into our skulls — hence all the wrinkles. Like a firework
        display, this canvas within our head is witness to several interesting thoughts, ideas, feelings,
        notions, memories and experiences that fire off in different regions. The act of writing serves
        to build the neural highways and the alleyways needed to connect these disparate regions and
        convert their sparks into a story that can help reproduce the same firework display in the
        mind of a reader. The job of a creative writer is to make this reproduction accurate, but
        not precise. One’s writing ought to convey the essence, but leave enough unstated between
        the lines so that the reader can reproduce their own variation of the same firework display.
         Defining writing as the means to clearly express whatever one feels is simple, but on digging
        deeper, one realizes how it is a craft that demands its own 10,000 hours of rigour.

        The more one writes, the more one realizes how building these intricate network of connections
        in the brain bestows several other skills. For instance, one learns to recognize bad writing
        almost instantly. The hallmark of bad writing is a feeling that the writer is making you work
        harder than you ought to in order to understand a particular idea. Seen this way, it becomes
        clear how bad grammar, spelling or word choice adds speed breakers and potholes on what ought
        to be a smooth road. Additionally, one also learns to recognize when a writer is using sophisticated
        language merely in a bid to sound smart while doing nothing to clarify what they are saying.
         In the manner of how a chef knows the quality of a dish no sooner than she spoons it into
        her mouth, a writer knows, after reading a paragraph or two, whether a piece of writing is
        well written.

        Despite having written everyday for so many days now, I am surprised by how writing a new
        post continues to be hard work. I still have days when I wake up and amble to the computer
        only to find myself clueless about expressing an idea that seemed crystal clear the evening
        before. Several of my posts have given me the impulse to hit delete and assume a new identity
        rather than put them out into the world. The benefit of sustaining a habit so long is that
        when the ugly monster of Resistance rears its head, it makes it harder for the practitioner
        to discontinue their practice on a whim. Nevertheless, I constantly ask myself whether this
        habit is worth the time and effort that I dedicate towards sustaining it. So far the answer
        has always been a ‘yes’, but someday that might change.
        </p>

        Even as I count the benefits my writing has given me I understand that it hasn’t done nearly
        as much for my readers. Like the patient roommate who puts up with somebody practicing the
        violin next door, you have received word of my posts as emails and on your social media feed.
         Writing a daily blog does much more for a writer than it ever can for a reader. I am grateful
        for anybody who has engaged with this blog in their own capacity — from silently reading a
        couple of posts to initiating conversations centered around the blog. Amidst this journey,
        I pause today to thank you for your generous help.
        </p>

        I have always thought of myself as a writer. Writing this blog has given me the action to
        back up this feeling. However, I realize that this is just a beginning. Having written a thousand
        blogposts, I aspire to write articles, essays, booklets and someday, books to voice the ever
        more intricate firework displays that light up inside my brain. As for this blog itself, I
        will continue to appear on stage and perform this daily dance until a clear voice within convinces
        me that it is time to pull down the curtains.
