      <h2>From MBA to software development</h2>
      <span class="date">Nov 2023</span>

      <p>
        In April 2015, I graduated as an MBA from one of India's leading business schools. I landed
        a well-paying job with excellent 'growth prospects', and I did so by drafting MBA responses
        to standard interview questions such as 'where do you see yourself 5 years from now'. I found myself on a career
        path that most Indians can only dream of.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fast-forward 5 years. In 2021, I switched career to software development with no background in
        IT. During my MBA, I had learnt of the sunk-cost fallacy. At this point, it seemed like my
        entire degree and career up until this point was sunk-cost. I was excited about the change,
        but at times, I felt like I was gambling away all my gains and starting from scratch. I feared
        that I would regret this decision. Also, those 5-year career visions, about which I had waxed eloquent
        in my interviews, seemed like blatant lies.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, the last two years (from 2021 to 2023) have been my happiest from a job perspective.
        I look forward to my Monday mornings and I haven't felt any regret (yet) for having taken the
        road less taken. Further, I had realized that some of my fears were unfounded. I wasn't starting
        over, and I continue to use a bunch of skills I have built from my previous careers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Occasionally, people reach out to me to ask about how I made the transition. That is my motivation for writing
        this post.
      </p>

      <h3>
        My Story
      </h3>

      <p>
        In Feb 2017, I moved to Germany. I joined the technology consulting practice in Deloitte Germany and was looking
        for a project. While I had some basic German skills, my German wasn't good enough for me to
        work effectively as a strategy consultant. I spent about 4 months on the bench, unable to
        secure a new project.
      </p>

      <p>
        I then overheard somebody in the office talking about a new Robotics Process Automation (RPA)
        practice within the firm. I was familiar with RPA, which is fancy jargon for writing simple
        UI based automation scripts to automate routine tasks that white-collar workers perform. Think
        of an excel macro on steroids - one that can read excel sheets, but also send emails or browse
        the web.
      </p>

      <p>
        The RPA hype train was just beginning in 2017 and the technology was in high demand. The RPA
        practice was desperate to hire consultants - all that they needed was an openness to getting one's fingers dirty
        with some programming. Given that the only thing I was doing with my fingers was twiddling them (especially
        the thumbs), I jumped at the opportunity. I received about a month's training on the job and learnt how to
        automate simple processes
        by using an RPA software - UiPath. This was my first foray into computer programming.
      </p>

      <p>
        I worked as an RPA programmer for a total of 4 years. Along the way, I noticed how I preferred
        programming to Powerpoint. I loved the excitement of writing scripts and seeing them come
        alive to automate routine tasks. I learnt
        to love the frustration of my programs not working as I expected. I loved debugging too -
        I felt like a detective who retraced his steps to detect the root cause of a bug. At some point, I realized that
        I couldn't go back to having my workdays filled with meetings where we nitpicked
        PowerPoints for punctuation and formatting.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2020, I became a UiPath MVP. I was one among 62 MVPs for the year, from a community of
        more than 500,000 users. I also switched employers to a small IT company that was setting
        up its own RPA practice. This sounded like an exciting opportunity - I was on the top of the
        RPA field and I now had the opportunity to establish a new practice from ground up. With renewed
        zeal, I set upon this task.
      </p>

      <p>
        But all of my lofty dreams were to come crashing down. Merely 6 weeks after I started, my
        employer decided to shut down the fledgling RPA practice. This was a sound
        decision from a business perspective, but it was a devastating blow to my own plans. Nevertheless,
        I decided to make the best of it. I had already realized that RPA and low-code automation
        had served as a great entry for me into the world of software development. However, I found
        them to now be a limitation - I wrote about this <a
          href="../../projects/descriptify/articles/articles/BiggestMistakeasRPADeveloper.html">here</a>.
        The next step in my evolution was to embrace a career in good old software development,
        without the 'low-code' baggage. I offered to stay on at my employer, by switching to QA and
        test automation. I then joined one of the software development teams within the firm.
      </p>

      <p>
        That switch was 2 years ago. I now feel well established in my position as a software developer with a focus on
        test automation. In this time, I was able to catalyse my team
        towards making our automated test pipeline 18x faster (from 3 hours to 10 min), set up two
        new test frameworks and speak about our work at a conference on two occasions. I wouldn't
        have been able to pull any of this off without my background in MBA and management consulting.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Insights on my journey
      </h3>

      <p>
        Reflecting on my experience, it becomes clear that none of this was planned. I moved organically
        from a career in strategy consulting to software development in several small steps. I am
        incredibly lucky to have had several turning points that helped me steer this transition.
        Nevertheless, when these opportunities came along, I had primed myself to exploit them.
      </p>

      <p>
        But it is worth pointing out that my move to Germany made this transition a lot easier. My
        life in Germany was a fresh start, where my prestigious MBA degree didn't mean anything. I
        was also liberated from the 'peer-pressure' of keeping up with my Indian batchmates, or from
        confirming to expectations that Indian society imposed on me. Most importantly, German work
        culture gave me plenty of slack to work on side-projects and upskill myself. When new opportunities
        did come along, I was ready to grab them.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I started my career as a software engineer, I had grossly underestimated the value of
        my MBA and consulting background. When I entered my team, I setup 1-on-1 meetings with various
        members to get an idea of the big picture. Almost instantly, I was able to recognize pain-points
        and bottlenecks. I then led efforts towards addressing a bottleneck - mainly by recruiting
        my colleagues to help me. I would then observe how they solved the problem and learn rapidly.
        I would start all over with the next bottleneck. All of this coordination stuff is second nature to an
        MBA. But these skills are rare (and sorely lacking) in software development teams. An MBA
        who joins the right development team can turn into a formidable force multiplier.
      </p>

      <p>
        But having presented the advantages, here are a couple of caveats. Several people are attracted
        to a career in software development because they enjoy programming. It is important to draw
        a distinction here. Programming is a creative activity with lots of freedom. A hobbyist who
        creates a musical fountain in her garden is a programmer. Software engineering, on the other
        hand, is no hobby. It is a serious discipline with rules and standards. Software engineering
        is also a social activity. Developers read 10x more code written by other developers than
        code that they write themselves. A day in the life of a software developer is very different
        from that of a hobby programmer. Before you embark on a career in software development, make
        sure you understand this difference.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, such a career transition is bound to be fraught with insecurity. There are times
        when I have struggled with a problem for hours, only to see my more experienced colleagues
        solve it in a jiffy. The side-projects that I am so proud of shipping will seem like the scribbles
        of a toddler to seasoned developers. There are days when I question whether I will ever stop
        feeling like an imposter in this profession. Part of this journey is to take such moments
        in your stride.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Suggestions
      </h3>

      <p>
        First and foremost, <b>think of why you want to transition to a career in software development</b>.
        If you are dissatisfied with your current job, or want to pursue software development for
        better pay, better work-life balance or some other extrinsic benefit, I would warn you against
        making the transition. Making this career transition is hard work and involves getting through
        the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dip">Dip</a>. The motivation for pursuing it needs to be
        intrinsic. You must be willing to do it for its own sake. Would you be willing to go through
        this transition even if you knew that it would fail? To put this motivation to litmus test, set aside some
        time
        to work on programming projects
        on the side. These projects could be as simple as doing exercises while reading a programming
        textbook and committing them to a git repository. Or coding a simple game (tic-tac-toe is
        a popular choice). See if you stick to these projects and are motivated to pursue them despite
        your current schedule. I see this as being the bare minimum for making the transition.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Approach this transition from a position of security, while taking a long-term view of your career.</b> Part
        of
        what
        made this transition so much easier for me was that I undertook it at a point
        where I was secure as an individual. I had stepped away from the corporate world by choice.
        I had carefully examined where my MBA career was leading and had decided that it wasn't for
        me. I didn't feel the need to prove anything to anybody. This automatically made failure less
        frightful. I also took a long-term view. I still have
        several decades of my career left. If this transition succeeded, I would have that much time
        to master my software development chops. If I failed in a year, it wouldn't matter much in the
        decades that followed. Taking a long-term view of my career also helped make the transition
        organic. I moved from strategy consulting to low code scripting to QA to automated testing.
        All these changes happened over several years, much like the evolution of an organism.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Seek out intersections between your current role and programming.</b> If you find yourself enjoying
        programming,
        see
        how you
        can combine it from within your current role. The easiest means to do this is to automate
        routine tasks that you or your team perform. Given that we live in the era of generative AI,
        writing such a script has never been easier. You can directly describe a task in human language
        and have it translated into a piece of code that you can play with and learn from. In several cases,
        finding and thriving in such an intersection is just the career pivot you may need, as opposed
        to a complete career switch. In any case, most programming jobs are not going to fit your
        profile. Therefore, reach out to your network and seek out situations where your intersection
        is in demand. Going through this transition would also mean carving out your own role.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Approach the transition from a position of strength.</b> When you think about this career transition, it is
        natural
        to approach it from a position
        of weakness. It is easy to mull over how most software developers are better than you, and
        how you don't stand a chance in holding your own in their presence. It is easy to fixate on
        the key skills that you lack and sink into despondency. Initially, this is what I had feared,
        but this fear turned out to be unfounded. True - there are things my colleagues can do that
        I cannot, but the opposite is also true. And while making this career transition, it is more
        helpful to double down on the latter. Given your background, write down where you have an
        edge over the average developer. Direct your efforts towards honing that edge, during your
        networking, interview preparations and while creating your professional brand. To sum it up,
        approach the transition from a position of strength. What you are going to bring to a software
        development team is likely to be much more than a fresher in the same job. Your strength as
        an MBA lies in cultivating your brand and telling that story well enough to land a job on
        good terms.
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Make the switch from within the same company.</b> I made this role transition from within the same company -
        from
        being an RPA developer to a regular
        software developer. It is easier to make this shift within the same company because you already
        have a high degree of trust and social capital within that company. However, given that most professionals
        don't
        have this possibility, this isn't a deal breaker.
      </p>
