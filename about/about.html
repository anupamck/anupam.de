            <p>
                I grew up in Bangalore and currently live in Berlin, Germany.
                This website houses my select creations on the World Wide Web.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a manager turned software developer.
                I work as a freelance test solution architect. I make sure that my clients' automated tests are set up
                to minimize quality risks
                and maximize business value. You can find our more about my work at <a href="https://anukrit.de/">my
                    professional website</a>, or at <a
                    href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anupam-krishnamurthy/">LinkedIn</a>.
            </p>
            I use the following 4 principles to choose what I work on:
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Improve ahead of innovate</strong> - explore the vast, but overlooked potential in improving
                    existing constructs rather than adding new ones</li>
                <li><strong>Subtract ahead of add</strong> - improve by subtracting rather than by adding</li>
                <li><strong>Focus on crises ahead of utopias</strong> - diminish suffering rather than maximize pleasure
                </li>
                <li><strong>Tackle neglected problems ahead of crowded problems</strong> - if somebody else is already
                    solving a
                    problem, thank them and move on</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                In my free time, you'll find me engrossed in a game of online chess, running long distances with a
                History podcast, or curled up in a corner with a book.

                    The good photographs on the site are my wife, Malavika's work (I am solely
                    to blame for the bad ones).
