        <p>
          I grew up in Bangalore and currently live in Berlin, Germany.
          This website houses my select creations on the World Wide Web.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a manager turned software developer.
          I currently work as a Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) - a developer who mostly writes automated tests.
          Given my background, I often stray into engineering management or management consulting.
        </p>
          I use the following 4 principles to choose what I work on:
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Improve ahead of innovate</strong> - explore the vast, but overlooked potential in improving existing constructs rather than adding new ones</li>
            <li><strong>Subtract ahead of add</strong> - improve by subtracting rather than by adding</li>
            <li><strong>Focus on crises ahead of utopias</strong> - diminish suffering rather than maximize pleasure</li>
            <li><strong>Tackle neglected problems ahead of crowded problems</strong> - if somebody else is already solving a problem, thank them and move on</li>
          </ol>
        </p>

            The design of this website is <span class="strikethrough">copied from</span> heavily
            inspired by Ivan Echeverria's <a href="https://www.echevarria.io/about" target="_blank">website</a>.
            Its source is <a href="https://github.com/anupamck/anupam.de" target="_blank">public</a>.<br><br>
            You can read about how this website got started <a href="../writing/essays/howThisSiteWasBorn.html">here</a>.

            The good photographs on the site are my wife, Malavika's work (I am solely
            to blame for the bad ones).
