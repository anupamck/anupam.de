        <h1>WeAreDevelopers 2022 - My 3 highlights</h1>

        <p>
        I was recently at the WeAreDevelopers World Congress 2022. This edition saw
        8000 techies congregate in Berlin. Given I live 30 min away and work for
        a generous employer, I had no excuse to miss it.
        </p>

        <p>
        I delivered a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bitgrip-gmbh_wad-wearedevelopers-developers-activity-6940954764213985281-JDUh">
        workshop</a> (with my team) at this event and attended about 15 talks. Here are
        the three talks that I benefitted the most from, along with links to their videos. It turns
        out that these talks were broad enough to benefit all manners of developers, and even some non-developers.
        </p>

        <h3>
        1. Design principles for the web
        </h3>

        <p>
        To design is to make trade-offs. As designers of the web, we are constantly trading off between
        the security of an app and its ease-of-use, the openness of our code vs. its profitability,
        the availability of our website on all manner of devices vs. a consistent user experience.
        </p>

        <p>
        Much like the decisions of a stock trader, our trade-offs need to be strategic lest we lose out to entropy.
        Well stated design principles align them with our purpose. In their absence, these trade-offs would be arbitrary,
        and each arbitrary decision chips away at the elegance of our creations.
        </p>
        <p>
        Jeremy Keith's talk tells
        you how to avoid this pitfall. Jeremy is one among my favourite human beings, and this talk is yet another of his gems.
        </p>

        <p>
        Jeremy's talk helped me realize how we have violated one of the world-wide-web's fundamental
        design principles. Remedying this violation was the topic of my second favourite talk.
        </p>

        <h3>
        2. Let's give the WWW back to the users
        </h3>

        <p>
        One of HTML's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/#priority-of-constituencies">
        design principles</a> reads, 'In case of conflict, consider users over authors over
        implementors over theoretical purity.'
        </p>

        <p>
        If you're a web developer, this is a great time to be alive. We have a wide playground of
        open-source tools to build, host, test, and deploy our creations on the web on our own terms.
        Yet, the same cannot be said of its end users, who have to rely on proprietary platforms to
        leave even the tiniest of dents on the web's vast portals.
        </p>

        <p>
        To post an event, users need a platform like Facebook or LinkedIn. For blogs, they need something
        like Wordpress or Medium. For taking notes, they rely on Evernote or Google Keep. Now all
        these platform rob them of the data they leave behind. The users also have no control over
        how this information is designed. They have no means to prevent an announcement for their
        birthday party from being branded in Facebook's corporate colours.
        </p>

        <p>
        The www came with the promise of enabling free and open human expression for its users. Yet,
        it is a shitty experience for end users today because they are locked into walled gardens
        of proprietary platforms.
        </p>

        <p>
        Joel Sapolsky, the creator of Stack Overflow among other wonderful things, wants to solve
        this problem through the <a href="https://blockprotocol.org/">Block Protocol</a> -
        interoperable components that are free, open-source and platform independent.
        If the protocol gains enough traction, it would be supported universally on the web.
        Migrating information between different platforms would turn seamless and the formats we need to
        organize information online - bullet points, checkboxes, tables, quotation marks - all
        of these would be open-source and free to use.
        </p>

        <p>
         What I loved about this talk is how Joel goes right to the root of this problem and seeks
        to address it there. If this intrigues you, be sure to check out his entire talk.

        <h3>
        3. Humanize your documentation
        </h3>

        <p>
        Something there is that doesn't love user-friendly documentation. We can all agree that we
        write documentation for human users (so far). Yet, only too often, our documentation is product-centric
        rather than user-centric.
        </p>

        <p>
        Let me illustrate. Most user documentation for a hand-held drilling machine would answer
        the following questions:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>How to adjust the speed of your drill.</li>
          <li>How to change the direction of the drill.</li>
          <li>How to change the drill bit.</li>
          <li>etc...</li>
        </ol>


        Yet, most hand-drill users care more about things like:
        <ol>
          <li>How to drill a hole in a flat surface (wood or plastic, metal, masonry).</li>
          <li>How to select the right screw for fastening items.</li>
          <li>How to drive screws (Philips, flat-head) with your drill.</li>
          <li>How to stir paint with your drill.</li>
          <li>etcâ€¦</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
        Good documentation is use-case driven. Much like user stories (which document requirements),
        it is centered on what a user wants to achieve with our product rather than the product itself.
         After this talk, I rewrote some of my team's internal documentation along these lines and
        was surprised to see how much more useable they became.
        </p>

        <p>
        This talk also gave me plenty to think about:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Why don't we write documentation like we write user-stories?</li>
          <li>Why don't we prioritize a document backlog along the lines of a product backlog?</li>
          <li>How can our documentation empathize with the mental state of its reader (hint - the dominant
          emotion that causes readers to read documentation is frustration at not being able to use
          our product)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>
        Honourable mentions
        </h3>

        <ol>
          <p>
            <li><strong>Extending HTML and CSS using web components</strong> - I always wanted to extend the plain vanilla
            HTML and CSS on this website with some plain vanilla Javascript. Rowdy Rabaou's excellent
            talk eliminated all my excuses for procrastinating this task. Unfortunately the organizers messed up
            with this talk's recording. You can find the <a href="https://rowdy.codes/talks/20220615-wearedevelopers-world-congress/">
            slides</a> to the talk on Rowdy's website.

            <li>
            <strong>The future of web development</strong> - Here's a maxim to predict the future of any field of software
            development  - that which is boring will be automated or abstracted away. Laurie Voss explains
            how a large chunk of future web developers will stop caring about HTML and CSS, and how that
            is a good thing. Watching this <a href="https://youtu.be/hWjT_OOBdOc?t=132" traget="_blank">talk</a>
            changed my mind about <q>whining about the fundamentals</q>.
