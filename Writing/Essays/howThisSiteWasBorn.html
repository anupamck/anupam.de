        <h2>How this website was born</h2>
        <p>
          For the longest time, my online creations were scattered across websites that I did
          not own. When I started a new career in a web-development firm in August 2021, it nudged
          me to learn HTML and CSS. I finally created this website both as a learning project and to
          give all my creations a singular address.
        </p>

        <p>
          I adopted a few principles to create this website.
        </p>

        <ol>
        <li>
          To create it from scratch, rather than using templates.
        </li>

        <li>
          To use only vanilla HTML and CSS, without web frameworks.
        </li>

        <li>
          To employ a minimal design. No frills.
        </li>

        </ol>

        <p>
          With these principles in mind, I trawled the web for inspiration and chanced upon Ivan Echeverria's
          <a href="https://www.echevarria.io/" target="_blank">website</a>. I was baffled to find how his site
          embodied my principles better than I could have imagined on my own.
          The striking similarities between his site and mine are no-coincidence. Thank you, Ivan. Until I
          progress enough to find my own style, your website has a doppelg√§nger.
        </p>

        <p>
          The inspiration to create a site of my own mainly came from
          <a href="https://sive.rs/" target="_blank">Derek Sivers</a>, whose work I have followed for
          years now. I acted upon his <a href="https://sive.rs/netskill">advice</a> to study
          <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Head-First-HTML-CSS-Standards-Based/dp/0596159900/" target="_blank">Head First HTML and CSS</a>,
          which gave me all the skills I needed to build this site out. Thank you, Derek.
        </p>

        <p>
          It took a total of about 26 hours of work to ship the first version of this website.
          Its source is <a href="https://github.com/anupamck/anupam.de" target="_blank">public</a>.
        </p>

        <p> This site now feels like my own little home within the vast portals of the World Wide Web.
           Thank you for stopping by.
