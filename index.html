        <h3 class="separator">What I am doing now</h3>
        <h4>Webdriver.IO, Javascript and Selenium</h4>
        <p>
          I am easing into my new career as a Quality Assurance Engineer. I am delving
          deeper into Webdriver.IO, a test framework for Node.js.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am also learning the basics of Javascript to write automated tests on browsers. Next on my
          agenda is Selenium, after which I intend to write automated tests for this website.
        </p>
        <h4>Sport</h4>
        <p>
          I am establishing a yoga routine. It occurs to me that yoga is a sport that is entirely
          intrinsic. It is also minimal to the extreme. Yoga is an internal battle against one's own
          mind and body. To practice it, you need merely a mind and a body.
