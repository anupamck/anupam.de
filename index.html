        <h3 class="separator">What I am doing now</h3>
        <h4>Vipassana</h4>
        <p>
          I attended a 10-day course in Vipassana meditation and found it to be a transformational
          experience. I wrote about the experience <a href="writing/essays/10DaysInSilence.html">here</a>.
          I now sustain this practice by meditating twice a day.
        </p>
        <h4>Willow DB</h4>
        <p>
          My next project is to build a simple web tool that will help me stay in touch with people.
          If I have fallen out of touch with somebody, the tool will remind me to get back in touch.

          I have already built a working prototype that  with Appsmith, a low-code solution to build
          simple frontend apps. I intend to rewrite the front-end in vanilla HTML and Javascript before
          sharing the tool for wider use.
        </p>
        <h4>Karate</h4>
        <p>
          At work, we have migrated to <a href="https://github.com/karatelabs/karate">Karate DSL</a>, for API Testing
          and have found it to be a powerful tool that is a pleasure to work with. Our focus is to now
          harness this tool's ability to perform Contract Testing by using
          <a href="https://github.com/karatelabs/karate/tree/master/karate-netty">API test doubles</a>.
        </p>
        <h4>Frontend Testing</h4>
        <p>
          At work, we are also exploring various frontend test frameworks to replace our existing setup.
          We have zeroed in <a href="https://cypress.io/">Cypress</a>
          and <a href="https://playwright.dev/">Playwright</a>, both of which I find to be extremely well crafted,
          thereby making it a difficult choice.
        </p>
        <h4>Sport</h4>
        <p>
          I have started playing some <a href="https://www.meetup.com/mixed-lazy-and-lousy-football/">friendly football</a> here in Berlin (admittedly 'Lazy and Lousy' football).
          I look forward to it every week!
        </p>
        <p>
          I continue to sustain 2 yoga sessions a week. It serves as a great complement to my
          efforts with Vipassana meditation.
