        <h3>What I am doing now</h3>
        <h4>New career</h4>
        <p>
          I recently started a new career as a Quality Assurance Engineer. I realize how my previous
          RPA development experience only scratched the surface of software engineering. The deeper I go,
          the more fascinating I find it.
        </p>
        <h4>HTML, CSS and Javascript</h4>
        <p>
          Since my new role is at a web development firm, I am learning the basics of HTML,
          CSS and Javascript. This website doubles up as a project to implement what I learn.
          This website has been handcrafted with lines of vanilla HTML and CSS.
        </p>
        <h4>Sport</h4>
        <p>
          In September 2021, I finished the Berlin Marathon. It was my first marathon and was an
          exhilarating experience. <br><br>
          I am now establishing a yoga routine. It occurs to me that yoga is an endeavour that
          is extremely minimal and entirely intrinsic. It is an internal battle against one's own
          mind and body and to practice it, you require nothing but a mind and a body.
