        <h3 class="separator">What I am doing now</h3>
        <h4>KIT (Keep In Touch)</h4>
        <p>
          My next project is to build a simple web tool that will help me stay in touch with people.
          If I have fallen out of touch with somebody, the tool will remind me to get back in touch.
          Watch this space for updates.
        </p>
        <h4>Karate</h4>
        <p>
          Next on my agenda at work is to explore <a href="https://github.com/karatelabs/karate">Karate DSL</a>, a nifty API test framework (sorry - this isn't about the martial art ðŸ¥‹).
          I also want to harness the framework's ability to perform Contract Testing by using <a href="https://github.com/karatelabs/karate/tree/master/karate-netty">API test doubles</a>.
        </p>
        <h4>Sport</h4>
        <p>
          I have started playing some friendly football here in Berlin (admittedly 'Lazy and Lousy' football).
          I look forward to it every week!
        </p>
        <p>
          I sustain 2 yoga sessions a week, where I sense slow, but significant progress.
          Yoga is a sport that is entirely intrinsic.
          It is also minimal to the extreme.
          Yoga is an internal battle against one's own mind and body.
          To practice it, you need merely a mind and a body.
