      <h3 class="separator">What I am doing now</h3>
      <h4>Quality team reorg</h4>
      <p>
        We have redefined our quality strategy and organized our quality team along the principles of <a
          href="https://teamtopologies.com/">Team
          Topologies</a>. We moved away from being 'quality gates' within project teams to shifting-left and enabling
        project teams to take ownership of quality themselves. Our aim is to put 'quality at source' to practice in our
        software teams.
      </p>
      <h4>Java</h4>
      <p>
        Java is pervasive in the tools I use for testing. I am almost done with the book <a
          href="https://www.amazon.de/Head-First-Java-Brain-Friendly-Guide/dp/1491910771">'Head First Java'</a>, which
        has helped me understand foundational concepts in Java such as inheritance, polymorphism, generic data types,
        streams, functional interfaces etc. I am now looking forward to implement these exciting constructs and
        contribute to some open-source tools that we use (Karate, Wiremock).
      </p>
      <h4>Gitlab</h4>
      <p>
        At the workplace, we are thankfully moving our CI pipelines from Jenkins to Gitlab. It has been great fun to
        rebuild our test pipelines with Gitlab and learn how this CI system works.
      </p>
      <h4>Running</h4>
      <p>
        I finished the Berlin Marathon in September, with a timing of 3:50:24.
      </p>
      <h4>India trip</h4>
      <p>
        I will be in India from 14 November to 9 January. I am looking forward to finishing this <a
