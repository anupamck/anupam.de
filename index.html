      <h3 class="separator">What I am doing now</h3>
      <h4>Application development</h4>
      <p>
        For the last 3.5 years, I have worked as a systems quality engineer and an SDET. In 2025, I am looking to
        broaden my software engineering skills beyond quality engineering and into application development.
      </p>
      <h4>Java</h4>
      <p>
        I am almost done with the book <a
          href="https://www.amazon.de/Head-First-Java-Brain-Friendly-Guide/dp/1491910771">'Head First Java'</a>, which
        has helped me understand foundational concepts in Java such as inheritance, polymorphism, generic data types,
        streams, functional interfaces etc. The next step is to use some of this knowledge to build a game, and to
        contribute to some open-source tools that we use (Karate, Wiremock).
      </p>
      <h4>Gitlab</h4>
      <p>
        At the workplace, we moved our CI pipelines from Jenkins to Gitlab. It has been great fun to
        learn how this CI system works.
      </p>
      <h4>Chess</h4>
      <p>
        This year has rekindled my interest for chess. I will be digging deeper into some theory to improve my game.
