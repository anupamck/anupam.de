        <h3 class="separator">What I am doing now</h3>
        <h4>Contract testing</h4>
        <p>
          At work, we are finding out ways in which we can reduce our exposure to
          changes at an external API. We are using Karate, an excellent API
          testing framework. We are now on the lookout for solutions to mock our
          external API's. My colleague and I spoke at a conference about this
          topic. I will post the recording of this talk as soon as I can get my
          hands on it.
        </p>
        <h4>Willow</h4>
        <p>
          I have built a simple tool to help me stay in touch with people. You can find the 
          details <a href="writing/essays/willow.html">here</a>. It is still lacking a few features, which I am working on.
        </p>
        <h4>Croatia trip</h4>
        <p>
          Will be visiting Croatia with family later this summer. Looking forward to some breathtaking 
          natural beauty, Roman relics and some great beaches.
