      <h3 class="separator">What I am doing now</h3>
      <h4>Contract testing</h4>
      <p>
        At work, we continue to use Wiremock to reduce our exposure to an
        external API. I spoke about this <a href="writing/essays/howYouTameAnExternalAPI.html">here.</a>We are using <a
          href="https://github.com/wiremock/wiremock">Wiremock</a>, an open-source tool, to create mock servers.
      </p>
      <p>
        That apart, we are redefining our quality strategy and organizing our quality teams along the principles of <a
          href="https://teamtopologies.com/">Team
          Topologies</a>. Exciting times ahead.
      </p>
      <h4>Reading</h4>
      <p>
        I recently read <a
          href="https://www.amazon.com/True-Purpose-Strategies-Discovering-Difference/dp/0615267939">True Purpose</a> by
        Tim Kelley. The book took me by storm and promises to transform my life. If you are in search of a clearer life
        purpose, I cannot recommend it enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been reading a lot of Swami Vivekananda lately. His is a spiritual voice that resonates with me
        deeply.
      </p>
      <h4>India trip</h4>
      <p>
        My recent trip to India was transformational. After having spent 7 years abroad, I am reexamining my own
        country with a fresh pair of eyes. What I see has shifted something within me. What I most admire is how so many
        Indians, despite having far less privilege than me, meet their life's challenges with utmost grace. During this
        trip, I fell in love with my country all over again.
