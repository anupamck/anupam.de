      <h3 class="separator">What I am doing now</h3>
      <h4>Freelancing</h4>
      <p>
        I recently quit my job as a systems quality engineer and an SDET at <a
          href="https://www.bitgrip.com/">Bitgrip</a> to take the plunge into freelancing.
        Having worked in consulting and services for 10+ years now, this is a logical continuation.
        You can check out my professional site <a href="https://anukrit.de">here</a>.
      </p>
      <h4>Upcoming talk - Shift Left, Move Forward</h4>
      <p>
        I spoke at the Berlin Quality Engineering Meetup on 17 April. <a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glgRCd5d8Ao">The talk</a> outlined the history of the
        Shift-Left
        movement and explored this often misunderstood term with concrete examples on how to apply it in a quality
        engineering context. </p>

      <h4>Running</h4>
      <p>
        I ran the Berlin Half-Marathon on April 6, where I set a personal record (1:44:23). Many thanks to <a
          href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/25369827">Bruno</a>, the sub-1:45 pacer at the event, who set
        the pace and kept me motivated throughout!

      </p>
      <h4>Java</h4>
      <p>
        I am done with the book <a href="https://www.amazon.de/Head-First-Java-Brain-Friendly-Guide/dp/1491910771">'Head
          First Java'</a>, which
        has helped me understand foundational concepts in Java such as inheritance, polymorphism, generic data
        types,
        streams, functional interfaces etc. The next step is to use some of this knowledge to build a project, and
        to
        contribute to some open-source tools that we use (Karate, Wiremock).
      </p>
      <h4>Chess</h4>
      <p>
        This year has rekindled my interest for chess. I will be digging deeper into some theory to improve my game.
