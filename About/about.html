          I grew up in Bangalore and currently live in Berlin, Germany.
        </p>
        <p>
          I currently work as a Quality Assurance Engineer - a developer who tests if
          a piece of software is working as it is expected to. In the past, I have worked
          as an RPA developer, a strategy consultant and a mechanical engineer in the Indian
          space programme. You can find me on
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anupam-krishnamurthy-b2568a63/" target="_blank">Linkedin</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy meaningful conversation. I aspire toward mastery, wisdom, kindness and
          generosity. You can write to me at <a href="mailto:anupam.ck@gmail.com">anupam.ck@gmail.com</a>.

            The design of this website is <span class="strikethrough">copied from</span> heavily
            inspired by Ivan Echeverria's <a href="https://www.echevarria.io/about.html" target="_blank">website</a>.
            Its source is <a href="https://github.com/anupamck/anupam.de" target="_blank">public</a>.<br><br>

            The good photographs on the site are my wife, Malavika's work (I am solely
            to blame for the bad ones).
