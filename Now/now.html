        <h3>Now</h3>
        <h4>New career</h4>
        <p>
          I recently started a new career as a Quality Assurance Engineer. I realize how my previous
          RPA development experience only scratched the surface of software engineering. The deeper I go,
          the more fascinating I find it.
        </p>
        <h4>HTML, CSS and Javascript</h4>
        <p>
          Since my new role is at a web development firm, I am learning the basics of HTML,
          CSS and Javascript. This website doubles up as a project to implement what I learn.
          This website has been handcrafted with lines of native HTML and CSS.
        </p>
        <h4>Sport</h4>
        <p>
          In September 2021,I finished the Berlin Marathon. It was my first marathon and was an
          exhilarating experience. I am now establishing a yoga routine and exploring the fascinating
          sport of bouldering.
