      <h3 class="separator">What is it for?</h3>
      <p>
        Hi, I am <a href="https://anupam.de/"> Anupam</a>.
        I have worked as an RPA developer for 4 years and currently work as a quality assurance
        engineer at a web-development firm.
      </p>
      <p>
        In early 2021, I was recognized as a <a
          href="https://forum.uipath.com/t/announcing-the-2021-uipath-mvps/295652">UiPath MVP</a> for my contributions
        to the RPA community.
        Descriptify is the umbrella under which I collect and share these contributions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given my recent switch to a quality assurance role, Descriptify will now lay a focus on:
      <ul>
        <li>RPA testing</li>
        <li>CI/CD</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="separator">Who is it for?</h3>
      <p>
        Within the RPA community, I sensed a gap for knowledge on how to build enterprise
        automation in a manner that is clean, stable and sustainable. If you are
        an RPA professional who cares about this as well, this portal is meant for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further, I also sensed a gap for material that was high in quality and respectful
        of the time and attention of its audience. Descriptify is my humble attempt at filling
        this gap.
      </p>
