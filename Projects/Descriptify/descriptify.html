          <h3>What is it for?</h3>
          <p>
            Hi, I am <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anupam-krishnamurthy-b2568a63/" target="_blank"> Anupam</a>.
            I have worked as an RPA developer for 4 years and currently work as a quality assurance
            engineer at a web-development firm.
          </p>
          <p>
            In early 2021, I was recognized as a <a href="https://forum.uipath.com/t/announcing-the-2021-uipath-mvps/295652"
            target="_blank">UiPath MVP</a> for my contributions to the RPA community.
            Descriptify is the umbrella under which I collect and share these contributions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Given my recent switch to a quality assurance role, Descriptify will now lay a focus on:
            <ul>
              <li>RPA testing</li>
              <li>CI/CD</li>
            </ul>

          <h3>Who is it for?</h3>
          <p>
            Within the RPA community, I sensed a gap for knowledge on how to build enterprise
            automation in a manner that is clean, stable and sustainable. If you are
            an RPA professional who cares about this as well, this portal is meant for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Further, I also sensed a gap for material that was high in quality and respectful
            of the time and attention of its audience. Descriptify is my humble attempt at filling
            this gap.
          </p>
